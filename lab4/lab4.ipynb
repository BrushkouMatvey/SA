      "0 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "1 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "2 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "3 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "4 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "5 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "6 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "7 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "8 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh

egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "9 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "10 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "11 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",

the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "13 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n",
      "14 ['the system which began to be called alchemy in the th and th centuries of our era had no special name before that time but was known as the sacred art the divine science the occult science the art of hermes a commentator on aristotle writing in the th century ad calls certain instruments used for fusion and calcination chuika organa that is instruments for melting and pouring hence probably came the adjective chyic or chymic and at a somewhat later time the word chemia as the name of that art which deals with calcinations fusions meltings and the like the writer of a treatise on astrology in the th century speaking of the influences of the stars on the dispositions of man says if a man is born under mercury he will give himself to astronomy if mars he will follow the profession of arms if saturn he will devote himself to the science of alchemy scientia alchemiae the word alchemia which appears in this treatise was formed by prefixing the arabic al meaning the to chemia a word as we have seen of greek origin it is the growth development and transformation into chemistry of this alchemia which we have to consider alchemy that is the art of melting pouring and transforming must necessarily pay much attention to working with crucibles furnaces alembics and other vessels wherein things are fused distilled calcined and dissolved the old drawings of alchemical operations show us men busy calcining cohobating distilling dissolving digesting and performing other processes of like character to these the alchemists could not be accused of laziness or aversion to work in their laboratories paracelsus th century says of them they are not given to idleness nor go in a proud habit or plush and velvet garments often showing their rings on their fingers or wearing swords with silver hilts by their sides or fine and gay gloves on their hands but diligently follow their labours sweating whole days and nights by their furnaces they do not spend their time abroad for recreation but take delight in their laboratories they put their fingers among coals into clay and filth not into gold rings they are sooty and black like smiths and miners and do not pride themselves upon clean and beautiful faces in these respects the chemist of to-day faithfully follows the practice of the alchemists who were his predecessors you can nose a chemist in a crowd by the smell of the laboratory which hangs about him you can pick him out by the stains on his hands and clothes he also takes delight in his laboratory he does not always pride himself on a clean and beautiful face he sweats whole days and nights by his furnace why does the chemist toil so eagerly why did the alchemists so untiringly pursue their quest i think it is not unfair to say the chemist experiments in order that he may liken his imaginings to the facts which he observes the alchemist toiled that he might liken the facts which he observed to his imaginings the difference may be put in another way by saying the chemists object is to discover how changes happen in combinations of the unchanging the alchemists endeavour was to prove the truth of his fundamental assertion that every substance contains undeveloped resources and potentialities and can be brought outward and forward into perfection looking around him and observing the changes of things the alchemist was deeply impressed by the growth and modification of plants and animals he argued that minerals and metals also grow change develop he said in effect nature is one there must be unity in all the diversity i see when a grain of corn falls into the earth it dies but this dying is the first step towards a new life the dead seed is changed into the living plant so it must be with all other things in nature the mineral or the metal seems dead when it is buried in the earth but in reality it is growing changing and becoming more perfect the perfection of the seed is the plant what is the perfection of the common metals evidently the alchemist replied the perfect metal is gold the common metals are trying to become gold gold is the intention of nature in regard to all metals said an alchemical writer plants are preserved by the preservation of their seed in like manner the alchemists argument proceeded there must be a seed in metals which is their essence if i can separate the seed and bring it under the proper conditions i can cause it to grow into the perfect metal animal life and human life also we may suppose the alchemist saying are continued by the same method as that whereby the life of plants is continued all life springs from seed the seed is fructified by the union of the male and the female in metals also there must be the two characters the union of these is needed for the production of new metals the conjoining of metals must go before the birth of the perfect metal now we may suppose the argument to proceed now the passage from the imperfect to the more perfect is not easy it is harder to practise virtue than to acquiesce in vice virtue comes not naturally to man that he may gain the higher life he must be helped by grace therefore the task of exalting the purer metals into the perfect gold of developing the lower order into the higher is not easy if nature does this she does it slowly and painfully if the exaltation of the common metals to a higher plane is to be effected rapidly it can be done only by the help of man so far as i can judge from their writings the argument of the alchemists may be rendered by some such form as the foregoing a careful examination of the alchemical argument shows that it rests on a supposed intimate knowledge of natures plan of working and the certainty that simplicity is the essential mark of that plan that the alchemists were satisfied of the great simplicity of nature and their own knowledge of the ways of natures work is apparent from their writings the author of the new chemical light th century says simplicity is the seal of truth nature is wonderfully simple and the characteristic mark of a childlike simplicity is stamped upon all that is true and noble in nature in another place the same author says nature is one true simple self-contained created of god and informed with a certain universal spirit the same author michael sendivogius remarks it may be asked how i come to have this knowledge about heavenly things which are far removed beyond human ken my answer is that the sages have been taught by god that this natural world is only an image and material copy of a heavenly and spiritual pattern that the very existence of this world is based upon the reality of its heavenly archetype thus the sage sees heaven reflected in nature as in a mirror and he pursues this art not for the sake of gold or silver but for the love of the knowledge which it reveals the only true way advises all who wish to become true alchemists to leave the circuitous paths of pretended philosophers and to follow nature which is simple the complicated processes described in books are said to be the traps laid by the cunning sophists to catch the unwary in a catechism of alchemy paracelsus asks what road should the philosopher follow he answers that exactly which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world', 'in the preceding chapter i have referred to the frequent use made by the alchemists of their supposition that nature follows the same plan or at any rate a very similar plan in all her processes if this supposition is accepted the primary business of an investigator of nature is to trace likenesses and analogies between what seem on the surface to be dissimilar and unconnected events as this idea and this practice were the foundations whereon the superstructure of alchemy was raised i think it is important to amplify them more fully than i have done already mention is made in many alchemical writings of a mythical personage named hermes trismegistus who is said to have lived a little later than the time of moses representations of hermes trismegistus are found on ancient egyptian monuments we are told that alexander the great found his tomb near hebron and that the tomb contained a slab of emerald whereon thirteen sentences were written the eighth sentence is rendered in many alchemical books as follows ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven and then again descend to the earth and unite together the powers of things superior and things inferior thus you will obtain the glory of the whole world and obscurity will fly away from you this sentence evidently teaches the unity of things in heaven and things on earth and asserts the possibility of gaining not merely a theoretical but also a practical knowledge of the essential characters of all things moreover the sentence implies that this fruitful knowledge is to be obtained by examining nature using as guide the fundamental similarity supposed to exist between things above and things beneath the alchemical writers constantly harp on this theme follow nature provided you never lose the clue which is simplicity and similarity the author of the only way  beseeches his readers to enlist under the standard of that method which proceeds in strict obedience to the teaching of nature  in short the method which nature herself pursues in the bowels of the earth the alchemists tell us not to expect much help from books and written directions when one of them has said all he can say he adds—the question is whether even this book will convey any information to one before whom the writings of the sages and the open book of nature are exhibited in vain another tells his readers the only thing for them is to beseech god to give you the real philosophical temper and to open your eyes to the facts of nature thus alone will you reach the coveted goal follow nature is sound advice but nature was to be followed with eyes closed save to one vision and the vision was to be seen before the following began the alchemists general conception of nature led them to assign to every substance a condition or state natural to it and wherein alone it could be said to be as it was designed to be each substance they taught could be caused to leave its natural state only by violent or non-natural means and any substance which had been driven from its natural condition by violence was ready and even eager to return to the condition consonant with its nature thus norton in his ordinal of alchemy says metals are generated in the earth for above ground they are subject to rust hence above ground is the place of corruption of metals and of their gradual destruction the cause which we assign to this fact is that above ground they are not in their proper element and an unnatural position is destructive to natural objects as we see for instance that fishes die when they are taken out of the water and as it is natural for men beasts and birds to live in the air so stones and metals are naturally generated under the earth in his new pearl of great price th century bonus says—the object of nature in all things is to introduce into each substance the form which properly belongs to it and this is also the design of our art this view assumed the knowledge of the natural conditions of the substances wherewith experiments were performed it supposed that man could act as a guide to bring back to its natural condition a substance which had been removed from that condition either by violent processes of nature or by mans device the alchemist regarded himself as an arbiter in questions concerning the natural condition of each substance he dealt with he thought he could say this substance ought to be thus or thus that substance is constrained thwarted hindered from becoming what nature meant it to be in ben jonsons play called the alchemist subtle who is the alchemist of the play says   metals would be gold if they had time the alchemist not only attributed ethical qualities to material things he also became the guardian and guide of the moral practices of these things he thought himself able to recall the erring metal to the path of metalline virtue to lead the extravagant mineral back to the moral home-life from which it had been seduced to show the doubting and vacillating salt what it was ignorantly seeking and to help it to find the unrealised object of its search the alchemist acted as a sort of conscience to the metals minerals salts and other substances he submitted to the processes of his laboratory he treated them as a wise physician might treat an ignorant and somewhat refractory patient i know what you want better than you do he seems often to be saying to the metals he is calcining separating joining and subliming but the ignorant alchemist was not always thanked for his treatment sometimes the patient rebelled for instance michael sendivogius in his tract the new chemical light drawn from the fountain of nature and of manual experience th century recounts a dialogue between mercury the alchemist and nature on a certain bright morning a number of alchemists met together in a meadow and consulted as to the best way of preparing the philosophers stone most of them agreed that mercury was the first substance others said no it was sulphur or something else just as the dispute began to run high there arose a violent wind which dispersed the alchemists into all the different countries of the world and as they had arrived at no conclusion each one went on seeking the philosophers stone in his own old way this one expecting to find it in one substance and that in another so that the search has continued without intermission even unto this day one of them however had at least got the idea into his head that mercury was the substance of the stone and determined to concentrate all his efforts on the chemical preparation of mercury he took common mercury and began to work with it he placed it in a glass vessel over the fire when it of course evaporated so in his ignorance he struck his wife and said no one but you has entered my laboratory you must have taken my mercury out of the vessel the woman with tears protested her innocence the alchemist put some more mercury into the vessel the mercury rose to the top of the vessel in vaporous steam then the alchemist was full of joy because he remembered that the first substance of the stone is described by the sages as volatile and he thought that now at last he must be on the right track he now began to subject the mercury to all sorts of chemical processes to sublime it and to calcine it with all manner of things with salts sulphur metals minerals blood hair aqua fortis herbs urine and vinegar everything he could think of was tried but without producing the desired effect the alchemist then despaired after a dream wherein an old man came and talked with him about the mercury of the sages the alchemist thought he would charm the mercury and so he used a form of incantation the mercury suddenly began to speak and asked the alchemist why he had troubled him so much and so on the alchemist replied and questioned the mercury the mercury makes fun of the philosopher then the alchemist again torments the mercury by heating him with all manner of horrible things at last mercury calls in the aid of nature who soundly rates the philosopher tells him he is grossly ignorant and ends by saying the best thing you can do is to give yourself up to the kings officers who will quickly put an end to you and your philosophy as long as men were fully persuaded that they knew the plan whereon the world was framed that it was possible for them to follow exactly the road which was followed by the great architect of the universe in the creation of the world a real knowledge of natural events was impossible for every attempt to penetrate natures secrets presupposed a knowledge of the essential characteristics of that which was to be investigated but genuine knowledge begins when the investigator admits that he must learn of nature not nature of him it might be truly said of one who held the alchemical conception of nature that his foible was omniscience and omniscience negatives the attainment of knowledge', 'the alchemists were sure that the intention of nature regarding metals was that they should become gold for gold was considered to be the most perfect metal and nature they said evidently strains after perfection the alchemist found that metals were worn away eaten through broken and finally caused to disappear by many acid and acrid liquids which he prepared from mineral substances but gold resisted the attacks of these liquids it was not changed by heat nor was it affected by sulphur a substance which changed limpid running mercury into an inert black solid hence gold was more perfect in the alchemical scale than any other metal since gold was considered to be the most perfect metal it was self-evident to the alchemical mind that nature must form gold slowly in the earth must transmute gradually the inferior metals into gold the only thing that distinguishes one metal from another writes an alchemist who went under the name of philalethes is its degree of maturity which is of course greatest in the most precious metals the difference between gold and lead is not one of substance but of digestion in the baser metal the coction has not been such as to purge out its metallic impurities if by any means this superfluous impure matter could be organically removed from the baser metals they would become gold and silver so miners tell us that lead has in many cases developed into silver in the bowels of the earth and we contend that the same effect is produced in a much shorter time by means of our art stories were told about the finding of gold in deserted mines which had been worked out long before these stories were supposed to prove that gold was bred in the earth the facts that pieces of silver were found in tin and lead mines and gold was found in silver mines were adduced as proofs that as the author of the new pearl of great price says nature is continually at work changing other metals into gold because though in a certain sense they are complete in themselves they have not yet reached the highest perfection of which they are capable and to which nature has destined them what nature did in the earth man could accomplish in the workshop for is not man the crown of the world the masterpiece of nature the flower of the universe was he not given dominion over all things when the world was created in asserting that the baser metals could be transmuted into gold and in attempting to effect this transmutation the alchemist was not acting on a vague haphazard surmise he was pursuing a policy dictated by his conception of the order of nature he was following the method which he conceived to be that used by nature herself the transmutation of metals was part and parcel of a system of natural philosophy if this transmutation were impossible the alchemical scheme of things would be destroyed the believer in the transmutation would be left without a sense of order in the material universe and moreover the alchemists conception of an orderly material universe was so intimately connected with his ideas of morality and religion that to disprove the possibility of the great transmutation would be to remove not only the basis of his system of material things but the foundations of his system of ethics also to take away his belief in the possibility of changing other metals into gold would be to convert the alchemist into an atheist how then was the transmutation to be accomplished evidently by the method whereby nature brings to perfection other living things for the alchemists belief in the simplicity and unity of nature compelled him to regard metals as living things plants are improved by appropriate culture by digging and enriching the soil by judicious selection of seed animals are improved by careful breeding by similar processes metals will be encouraged and helped towards perfection the perfect state of gold will not be reached at a bound it will be gained gradually many partial purifications will be needed as subtle says in the alchemist— twere absurd to think that nature in the earth bred gold perfect in the instant something went before there must be remote matter nature doth first beget the imperfect then proceeds she to the perfect at this stage the alchemical argument becomes very ultra-physical it may perhaps be rendered somewhat as follows— man is the most perfect of animals in man there is a union of three parts these are body soul and spirit metals also may be said to have a body a soul and a spirit there is a specific bodily or material form belonging to each metal there is a metalline soul characteristic of this or that class of metals there is a spirit or inner immaterial potency which is the very essence of all metals the soul and spirit of man are clogged by his body if the spiritual nature is to become the dominating partner the body must be mortified the alchemists of course used this kind of imagery and it was very real to them in like manner the spirit of metals will be laid bare and enabled to exercise its transforming influences only when the material form of the individual metal has been destroyed the first thing to do then is to strip off and cast aside those properties of metals which appeal to the senses it is necessary to deprive matter of its qualities in order to draw out its soul said stephanus of alexandria in the th century and in the th century paracelsus said nothing of true value is located in the body of a substance but in the virtue  the less there is of body the more in proportion is the virtue but the possession of the soul of metals is not the final stage mastery of the soul may mean the power of transmuting a metal into another like itself it will not suffice for the great transmutation for in that process a metal becomes gold the one and only perfect metal hence the soul also must be removed in order that the spirit the essence the kernel may be obtained and as it is with metals so the alchemists argued it is with all things there are a few principles which may be thought of as conditioning the specific bodily and material forms of things beneath these there are certain elements which are common to many things whose principles are not the same and hidden by the wrappings of elements and principles there is the one essence the spirit the mystic uniting bond the final goal of the philosopher i propose in this chapter to try to analyse the alchemical conceptions of elements and principles and in the next chapter to attempt some kind of description of the essence', 'in the last chapter i tried to describe the alchemical view of the interdependence of different substances taking for granted the tripartite nature of man the co-existence in him of body soul and spirit no one of which was defined the alchemists concluded that all things are formed as man is formed that in everything there is a specific bodily form some portion of soul and a dash of spirit i considered the term soul to be the alchemical name for the properties common to a class of substances and the term spirit to mean the property which was thought by the alchemists to be common to all things the alchemists considered it possible to arrange all substances in four general classes the marks whereof were expressed by the terms hot cold moist and dry they thought of these properties as typified by what they called the four elements—fire air water and earth everything they taught was produced from the four elements not immediately but through the mediation of the three principles—mercury sulphur and salt these principles were regarded as the tools put into the hands of him who desired to effect the transmutation of one substance into another the principles were not thought of as definite substances nor as properties of this or that specified substance they were considered to be the characteristic properties of large classes of substances the chemist of to-day places many compounds in the same class because all are acids because all react similarly under similar conditions it used to be said that every acid possesses more or less of the principle of acidity lavoisier changed the language whereby certain facts concerning acids were expressed he thought that experiments proved all acids to be compounds of the element oxygen and for many years after lavoisier the alchemical expression the principle of acidity was superseded by the word oxygen although lavoisier recognised that not every compound of oxygen is an acid he taught that every acid is a compound of oxygen we know now that many acids are not compounds of oxygen but we have not yet sufficient knowledge to frame a complete definition of the term acid nevertheless it is convenient indeed it is necessary to place together many compounds which react similarly under certain defined conditions and to give a common name to them all the alchemists also classified substances but their classification was necessarily more vague than ours and they necessarily expressed their reasons for putting different substances in the same class in a language which arose out of the general conceptions of natural phenomena which prevailed in their time the primary classification of substances made by the alchemists was expressed by saying these substances are rich in the principle sulphur those contain much of the principle mercury and this class is marked by the preponderance of the principle salt the secondary classification of the alchemists was expressed by saying this class is characterised by dryness that by moisture another by coldness and a fourth by hotness the dry substances contain much of the element earth the moist substances are rich in the element water in the cold substances the element air preponderates and the hot substances contain more of the element fire than of the other elements the alchemists went a step further in their classification of things they asserted that there is one thing present in all things that everything is a vehicle for the more or less perfect exhibition of the properties of the one thing that there is a primal element common to all substances the final aim of alchemy was to obtain the one thing the primal element the soul of all things so purified not only from all specific substances but also from all admixture of the four elements and the three principles as to make possible the accomplishment of any transmutation by the use of it if a person ignorant of its powers were to obtain the essence he might work vast havoc and cause enormous confusion it was necessary therefore to know the conditions under which the potencies of the essence became active hence there was need of prolonged study of the mutual actions of the most seemingly diverse substances and of minute and patient examination of the conditions under which nature performs her marvellous transmutations the quest of the one thing was fraught with peril and was to be attempted only by those who had served a long and laborious apprenticeship in the chemical treatise of thomas norton the englishman called believe-me or the ordinal of alchemy th century the adept is warned not to disclose his secrets to ordinary people you should carefully test and examine the life character and mental aptitudes of any person who would be initiated in this art and then you should bind him by a sacred oath not to let our magistery be commonly or vulgarly known only when he begins to grow old and feeble he may reveal it to one person but not to more and that one man must be virtuous if any wicked man should learn to practise the art the event would be fraught with great danger to christendom for such a man would overstep all bounds of moderation and would remove from their hereditary thrones those legitimate princes who rule over the peoples of christendom the results of the experimental examination of the compositions and properties of substances made since the time of the alchemists have led to the modern conception of the chemical element and the isolation of about seventy or eighty different elements no substance now called an element has been produced in the laboratory by uniting two or more distinct substances nor has any been separated into two or more unlike portions the only decided change which a chemical element has been caused to undergo is the combination of it with some other element or elements or with a compound or compounds but it is possible that all the chemical elements may be combinations of different quantities of one primal element certain facts make this supposition tenable and some chemists expect that the supposition will be proved to be correct if the hypothetical primal element should be isolated we should have fulfilled the aim of alchemy and gained the one thing but the fulfilment would not be that whereof the alchemists dreamed inasmuch as the alchemical essence was thought of as the universal spirit to whose presence is due whatever degree of perfection any specific substance exhibits it followed that the more perfect a substance the greater is the quantity of the essence in it but even in the most perfect substance found in nature—which substance the alchemists said is gold—the essence is hidden by wrappings of specific properties which prevent the ordinary man from recognising it remove these wrappings from some special substance and you have the perfect form of that thing you have some portion of the universal spirit joined to the one general property of the class of things whereof the particular substance is a member then remove the class-property often spoken of by the alchemists as the life of the substance and you have the essence itself the alchemists thought that to every thing or at any rate to every class of things there corresponds a more perfect form than that which we see and handle they spoke of gold and the gold of the sages mercury and the mercury of the philosophers sulphur and the heavenly sulphur of him whose eyes are opened to remove the outer wrappings of ordinary properties which present themselves to the untrained senses was regarded by the alchemists to be a difficult task to tear away the soul the class-property of a substance and yet retain the essence which made that substance its dwelling place was possible only after vast labour and by the use of the proper agent working under the proper conditions an exceedingly powerful delicate and refined agent was needed and the mastery of the agent was to be acquired by bitter experience and probably after many disappointments gold an alchemist tells us does not easily give up its nature and will fight for its life but our agent is strong enough to overcome and kill it and then it also has the power to restore it to life and to change the lifeless remains into a new and pure body', 'the vagueness of the general conceptions of alchemy and the attribution of ethical qualities to material things by the alchemists necessarily led to the employment of a language which is inexact undescriptive and unsuggestive to modern ears the same name was given to different things and the same thing went under many names in chapter iv i endeavoured to analyse two terms which were constantly used by the alchemists to convey ideas of great importance the terms element and principle that attempt sufficed at any rate to show the vagueness of the ideas which these terms were intended to express and to make evident the inconsistencies between the meanings given to the words by different alchemical writers the story quoted in chapter iii from michael sendivogius illustrates the difficulty which the alchemists themselves had in understanding what they meant by the term mercury yet there is perhaps no word more often used by them than that some of them evidently took it to mean the substance then and now called mercury the results of this literal interpretation were disastrous others thought of mercury as a substance which could be obtained or at any rate might be obtained by repeatedly distilling ordinary mercury both alone and when mixed with other substances others used the word to mean a hypothetical something which was liquid but did not wet things limpid yet capable of becoming solid volatile yet able to prevent the volatilisation of other things and white yet ready to cause other white things to change their colour they thought of this something this soul of mercury as having properties without itself being tangible as at once a substance and not a substance at once a bodily spirit and a spiritual body it was impossible to express the alchemical ideas in any language save that of far-fetched allegory the alchemical writings abound in such allegories here are two of them the first allegory is taken from the twelve keys of basilius valentinus the benedictine— the eleventh key to the knowledge of the augmentation of our stone i will put before you in the form of a parable there lived in the east a gilded knight named orpheus who was possessed of immense wealth and had everything that heart can wish he had taken to wife his own sister euridice who did not however bear him any children this he regarded as the punishment of his sin in having wedded his own sister and was instant in prayer to god both by day and by night that the curse might be taken from him one night when he was buried in a deep sleep there came to him a certain winged messenger named phbus who touched his feet which were very hot and said thou noble knight since thou hast wandered through many cities and kingdoms and suffered many things at sea in battle and in the lists the heavenly father has bidden me make known to thee the following means of obtaining thy prayer take blood from thy right side and from the left side of thy spouse for this blood is the hearts blood of your parents and though it may seem to be of two kinds yet in reality it is only one mix the two kinds of blood and keep the mixture tightly enclosed in the globe of the seven wise masters then that which is generated will be nourished with its own flesh and blood and will complete its course of development when the moon has changed for the eighth time if thou repeat this process again and again thou shalt see childrens children and the offspring of thy body shall fill the world when phbus had thus spoken he winged his flight heavenward in the morning the knight arose and did the bidding of the celestial messenger and god gave to him and to his wife many children who inherited their fathers glory wealth and knightly honours from generation to generation in the dedicatory epistle to his triumphal chariot of antimony basil valentine addresses his brother alchemists as follows— mercury appeared to me in a dream and brought me back from my devious courses to the one way behold me clad not in the garb of the vulgar but in the philosophers mantle so he said and straightway began to leap along the road in headlong bounds then when he was tired he sat down and turning to me who had followed him in the spirit bade me mark that he no longer possessed that youthful vigour with which he would at the first have overcome every obstacle if he had not been allowed a free course encouraged by his friendly salutation i addressed him in the following terms mercury eloquent scion of atlas and father of all alchemists since thou hast guided me hitherto shew me i pray thee the way to those blessed isles which thou hast promised to reveal to all thine elect children dost thou remember he replied that when i quitted thy laboratory i left behind me a garment so thoroughly saturated with my own blood that neither the wind could efface it nor all-devouring time destroy its indelible essence fetch it hither to me that i may not catch a chill from the state of perspiration in which i now am but let me clothe myself warmly in it and be closely incited thereto so that i may safely reach my bride who is sick with love she has meekly borne many wrongs being driven through water and fire and compelled to ascend and descend times without number—yet has she been carried through it all by the hope of entering with me the bridal chamber wherein we expect to beget a son adorned from his birth with the royal crown which he may not share with others yet may he bring his friends to the palace where sits enthroned the king of kings who communicates his dignity readily and liberally to all that approach him i brought him the garment and it fitted him so closely that it looked like an iron skin securing him against all the assaults of vulcan let us proceed he then said and straightway sped across the open field while i boldly strove to keep up with my guide thus we reached his bride whose virtue and constancy were equal to his own there i beheld their marvellous conjugal union and nuptial consummation whence was born the son crowned with the royal diadem when i was about to salute him as king of kings and lord of lords my genius stood by me and warned me not to be deceived since this was only the kings forerunner but not the king himself whom i sought when i heard the admonition i did not know whether to be sad or joyful depart then said mercury with this bridal gift and when you come to those disciples who have seen the lord himself show them this sign and therewith he gave me a gold ring from his sons finger they know the golden branch which must be consecrated to proserpina before you can enter the palace of pluto when he sees this ring perhaps one will open to you with a word the door of that chamber where sits enthroned in his magnificence the desire of all nations who is known only to the sages when he had thus spoken the vision vanished but the bridal gift which i still held in my hand shewed me that it had not been a mere dream it was of gold but to me more precious than the most prized of all metals unto you i will shew it when i am permitted to see your faces and to converse with you freely till that earnestly wished-for time i bid you farewell one result of the alchemical modes of expression was that he who tried to follow the directions given in alchemical books got into dire confusion he did not know what substances to use in his operations for when he was told to employ the homogeneous water of gold for example the expression might mean anything and in despair he distilled and calcined and cohobated and tried to decompose everything he could lay hands on those who pretended to know abused and vilified those who differed from them', 'the growth of intelligence in the human race has its counterpart in that of the individual especially in the earliest stages intellectual activity and the development of reasoning powers are in both cases based upon the accumulation of experiences and on the comparison classification arrangement and nomenclature of these experiences during the infancy of each the succession of events can be watched but there can be no a priori anticipations experience alone in both cases leads to the idea of cause and effect as a principle that seems to dominate our present universe as a rule for predicting the course of events and as a guide to the choice of a course of action this idea of cause and effect is the most potent factor in developing the history of the human race as of the individual in no realm of nature is the principle of cause and effect more conspicuous than in astronomy and we fall into the habit of thinking of its laws as not only being unchangeable in our universe but necessary to the conception of any universe that might have been substituted in its place the first inhabitants of the world were compelled to accommodate their acts to the daily and annual alternations of light and darkness and of heat and cold as much as to the irregular changes of weather attacks of disease and the fortune of war they soon came to regard the influence of the sun in connection with light and heat as a cause this led to a search for other signs in the heavens if the appearance of a comet was sometimes noted simultaneously with the death of a great ruler or an eclipse with a scourge of plague these might well be looked upon as causes in the same sense that the veering or backing of the wind is regarded as a cause of fine or foul weather for these reasons we find that the earnest men of all ages have recorded the occurrence of comets eclipses new stars meteor showers and remarkable conjunctions of the planets as well as plagues and famines floods and droughts wars and the deaths of great rulers sometimes they thought they could trace connections which might lead them to say that a comet presaged famine or an eclipse war even if these men were sometimes led to evolve laws of cause and effect which now seem to us absurd let us be tolerant and gratefully acknowledge that these astrologers when they suggested such working hypotheses were laying the foundations of observation and deduction if the ancient chaldans gave to the planetary conjunctions an influence over terrestrial events let us remember that in our own time people have searched for connection between terrestrial conditions and periods of unusual prevalence of sun spots while de la rue loewy and balfour stewart thought they found a connection between sun-spot displays and the planetary positions thus we find scientific men even in our own time responsible for the belief that storms in the indian ocean the fertility of german vines famines in india and high or low nile-floods in egypt follow the planetary positions and again the desire to foretell the weather is so laudable that we cannot blame the ancient greeks for announcing the influence of the moon with as much confidence as it is affirmed in lord wolseley’s soldier’s pocket book even if the scientific spirit of observation and deduction astronomy has sometimes led to erroneous systems for predicting terrestrial events astrology we owe to the old astronomer and astrologer alike the deepest gratitude for their diligence in recording astronomical events for out of the scanty records which have survived the destructive acts of fire and flood of monarchs and mobs we have found much that has helped to a fuller knowledge of the heavenly motions than was possible without these records so hipparchus about  bc and ptolemy a little later were able to use the observations of chaldan astrologers as well as those of alexandrian astronomers and to make some discoveries which have helped the progress of astronomy in all ages so also mr cowell has examined the marks made on the baked bricks used by the chaldans for recording the eclipses of  bc and  bc and has thereby been enabled in the last few years to correct the lunar tables of hansen and to find a more accurate value for the secular acceleration of the moon’s longitude and the node of her orbit than any that could be obtained from modern observations made with instruments of the highest precision so again mr hind  was enabled to trace back the period during which halley’s comet has been a member of the solar system and to identify it in the chinese observations of comets as far back as  bc cowell and cromellin extended the date to  bc in the same way the comet i has been traced back in the chinese records to  ad  the theoretical views founded on newton’s great law of universal gravitation led to the conclusion that the inclination of the earth’s equator to the plane of her orbit the obliquity of the ecliptic has been diminishing slowly since prehistoric times and this fact has been confirmed by egyptian and chinese observations on the length of the shadow of a vertical pillar made thousands of years before the christian era in summer and winter there are other reasons why we must be tolerant of the crude notions of the ancients the historian wishing to give credit wherever it may be due is met by two difficulties firstly only a few records of very ancient astronomy are extant and the authenticity of many of these is open to doubt secondly it is very difficult to divest ourselves of present knowledge and to appreciate the originality of thought required to make the first beginnings with regard to the first point we are generally dependent upon histories written long after the events the astronomy of egyptians babylonians and assyrians is known to us mainly through the greek historians and for information about the chinese we rely upon the researches of travellers and missionaries in comparatively recent times the testimony of the greek writers has fortunately been confirmed and we now have in addition a mass of facts translated from the original sculptures papyri and inscribed bricks dating back thousands of years in attempting to appraise the efforts of the beginners we must remember that it was natural to look upon the earth as all the first astronomers did as a circular plane surrounded and bounded by the heaven which was a solid vault or hemisphere with its concavity turned downwards the stars seemed to be fixed on this vault the moon and later the planets were seen to crawl over it it was a great step to look on the vault as a hollow sphere carrying the sun too it must have been difficult to believe that at midday the stars are shining as brightly in the blue sky as they do at night it must have been difficult to explain how the sun having set in the west could get back to rise in the east without being seen if it was always the same sun it was a great step to suppose the earth to be spherical and to ascribe the diurnal motions to its rotation probably the greatest step ever made in astronomical theory was the placing of the sun moon and planets at different distances from the earth instead of having them stuck on the vault of heaven it was a transition from flatland to a space of three dimensions great progress was made when systematic observations began such as following the motion of the moon and planets among the stars and the inferred motion of the sun among the stars by observing their heliacal risings—ie the times of year when a star would first be seen to rise at sunrise and when it could last be seen to rise at sunset the grouping of the stars into constellations and recording their places was a useful observation the theoretical prediction of eclipses of the sun and moon and of the motions of the planets among the stars became later the highest goal in astronomy to not one of the above important steps in the progress of astronomy can we assign the author with certainty probably many of them were independently taken by chinese indian persian tartar egyptian babylonian assyrian phoenician and greek astronomers and we have not a particle of information about the discoveries which may have been great by other peoples—by the druids the mexicans and the peruvians for example we do know this that all nations required to have a calendar the solar year the lunar month and the day were the units and it is owing to their incommensurability that we find so many calendars proposed and in use at different times the only object to be attained by comparing the chronologies of ancient races is to fix the actual dates of observations recorded and this is not a part of a history of astronomy in conclusion let us bear in mind the limited point of view of the ancients when we try to estimate their merit let us remember that the first astronomy was of two dimensions the second astronomy was of three dimensions but still purely geometrical since kepler’s day we have had a dynamical astronomy ', 'the last section must have made clear the difficulties the way of assigning to the ancient nations their proper place in the development of primitive notions about astronomy the fact that some alleged observations date back to a period before the chinese had invented the art of writing leads immediately to the question how far tradition can be trusted our first detailed knowledge was gathered in the far east by travellers and by the jesuit priests and was published in the eighteenth century the asiatic society of bengal contributed translations of brahmin literature the two principal sources of knowledge about chinese astronomy were supplied first by father souciet who in  published observations astronomical geographical chronological and physical drawn from ancient chinese books and later by father moyriac-de-mailla who in - published annals of the chinese empire translated from tong-kien-kang-mou bailly in his astronomie ancienne  drew from these and other sources the conclusion that all we know of the astronomical learning of the chinese indians chaldans assyrians and egyptians is but the remnant of a far more complete astronomy of which no trace can be found delambre in his histoire de l’astronomie ancienne  ridicules the opinion of bailly and considers that the progress made by all of these nations is insignificant it will be well now to give an idea of some of the astronomy of the ancients not yet entirely discredited china and babylon may be taken as typical examples china—it would appear that fohi the first emperor reigned about  bc and shortly afterwards yu-chi made a sphere to represent the motions of the celestial bodies it is also mentioned in the book called chu-king supposed to have been written in  bc that a similar sphere was made in the time of yao  bc it is said that the emperor chueni  bc saw five planets in conjunction the same day that the sun and moon were in conjunction this is discussed by father martin mss of de lisle also by m desvignolles mem acad berlin vol iii p  and by m kirsch ditto vol v p  who both found that mars jupiter saturn and mercury were all between the eleventh and eighteenth degrees of pisces all visible together in the evening on february th  bc while on the same day the sun and moon were in conjunction at  am and that on march st the moon was in conjunction with the other four planets but this needs confirmation yao referred to above gave instructions to his astronomers to determine the positions of the solstices and equinoxes and they reported the names of the stars in the places occupied by the sun at these seasons and in  bc he gave them further orders if this account be true it shows a knowledge that the vault of heaven is a complete sphere and that stars are shining at mid-day although eclipsed by the sun’s brightness it is also asserted in the book called chu-king that in the time of yao the year was known to have  days and that he adopted  days and added an intercalary day every four years as in the julian calendar this may be true or not but the ancient chinese certainly seem to have divided the circle into  degrees to learn the length of the year needed only patient observation—a characteristic of the chinese but many younger nations got into a terrible mess with their calendar from ignorance of the year’s length it is stated that in  bc the royal astronomers hi and ho failed to predict an eclipse it probably created great terror for they were executed in punishment for their neglect if this account be true it means that in the twenty-second century bc some rule for calculating eclipses was in use here again patient observation would easily lead to the detection of the eighteen-year cycle known to the chaldeans as the saros it consists of  lunations and in that time the pole of the moon’s orbit revolves just once round the pole of the ecliptic and for this reason the eclipses in one cycle are repeated with very slight modification in the next cycle and so on for many centuries it may be that the neglect of their duties by hi and ho and their punishment influenced chinese astronomy or that the succeeding records have not been available to later scholars but the fact remains that—although at long intervals observations were made of eclipses comets and falling stars and of the position of the solstices and of the obliquity of the ecliptic—records become rare until  bc when eclipses began to be recorded once more with some approach to continuity shortly afterwards notices of comets were added biot gave a list of these and mr john williams in  published observations of comets from  bc to  ad extracted from the chinese annals with regard to those centuries concerning which we have no astronomical chinese records it is fair to state that it is recorded that some centuries before the christian era in the reign of tsin-chi-hoang all the classical and scientific books that could be found were ordered to be destroyed if true our loss therefrom is as great as from the burning of the alexandrian library by the caliph omar he burnt all the books because he held that they must be either consistent or inconsistent with the koran and in the one case they were superfluous in the other case objectionable chaldans—until the last half century historians were accustomed to look back upon the greeks who led the world from the fifth to the third century bc as the pioneers of art literature and science but the excavations and researches of later years make us more ready to grant that in science as in art the greeks only developed what they derived from the egyptians babylonians and assyrians the greek historians said as much in fact and modern commentators used to attribute the assertion to undue modesty since however the records of the libraries have been unearthed it has been recognised that the babylonians were in no way inferior in the matter of original scientific investigation to other races of the same era the chaldans being the most ancient babylonians held the same station and dignity in the state as did the priests in egypt and spent all their time in the study of philosophy and astronomy and the arts of divination and astrology they held that the world of which we have a conception is an eternal world without any beginning or ending in which all things are ordered by rules supported by a divine providence and that the heavenly bodies do not move by chance nor by their own will but by the determinate will and appointment of the gods they recorded these movements but mainly in the hope of tracing the will of the gods in mundane affairs ptolemy about  ad made use of babylonian eclipses in the eighth century bc for improving his solar and lunar tables fragments of a library at agade have been preserved at nineveh from which we learn that the star-charts were even then divided into constellations which were known by the names which they bear to this day and that the signs of the zodiac were used for determining the courses of the sun moon and of the five planets mercury venus mars jupiter and saturn we have records of observations carried on under asshurbanapal who sent astronomers to different parts to study celestial phenomena here is one— to the director of observations—my lord his humble servant nabushum-iddin great astronomer of nineveh writes thus may nabu and marduk be propitious to the director of these observations my lord the fifteenth day we observed the node of the moon and the moon was eclipsed the phoenicians are supposed to have used the stars for navigation but there are no records the egyptian priests tried to keep such astronomical knowledge as they possessed to themselves it is probable that they had arbitrary rules for predicting eclipses all that was known to the greeks about egyptian science is to be found in the writings of diodorus siculus but confirmatory and more authentic facts have been derived from late explorations thus we learn from e b knobel about the jewish calendar dates on records of land sales in aramaic papyri at assuan translated by professor a h sayce and a e cowley  that the lunar cycle of nineteen years was used by the jews in the fifth century bc the present reformed jewish calendar dating from the fourth century ad a date a little more than a century after the grandfathers and great-grandfathers of those whose business is recorded had fled into egypt with jeremiah sayce and  that the order of intercalation at that time was not dissimilar to that in use at the present day then again knobel reminds us of the most interesting discovery a few years ago by father strassmeier of a babylonian tablet recording a partial lunar eclipse at babylon in the seventh year of cambyses on the fourteenth day of the jewish month tammuz ptolemy in the almagest suntaxis says it occurred in the seventh year of cambyses on the night of the seventeenth and eighteenth of the egyptian month phamenoth pingre and oppolzer fix the date july th  bc thus are the relations of the chronologies of jews and egyptians established by these explorations', 'we have our information about the earliest greek astronomy from herodotus born  bc he put the traditions into writing thales - bc is said to have predicted an eclipse which caused much alarm and ended the battle between the medes and lydians airy fixed the date may th  bc but other modern astronomers give different dates thales went to egypt to study science and learnt from its priests the length of the year which was kept a profound secret! and the signs of the zodiac and the positions of the solstices he held that the sun moon and stars are not mere spots on the heavenly vault but solids that the moon derives her light from the sun and that this fact explains her phases that an eclipse of the moon happens when the earth cuts off the sun’s light from her he supposed the earth to be flat and to float upon water he determined the ratio of the sun’s diameter to its orbit and apparently made out the diameter correctly as half a degree he left nothing in writing his successors anaximander - bc and anaximenes - bc held absurd notions about the sun moon and stars while heraclitus - bc supposed that the stars were lighted each night like lamps and the sun each morning parmenides supposed the earth to be a sphere pythagoras - bc visited egypt to study science he deduced his system in which the earth revolves in an orbit from fantastic first principles of which the following are examples the circular motion is the most perfect motion fire is more worthy than earth ten is the perfect number he wrote nothing but is supposed to have said that the earth moon five planets and fixed stars all revolve round the sun which itself revolves round an imaginary central fire called the antichthon copernicus in the sixteenth century claimed pythagoras as the founder of the system which he copernicus revived anaxagoras born  bc studied astronomy in egypt he explained the return of the sun to the east each morning by its going under the flat earth in the night he held that in a solar eclipse the moon hides the sun and in a lunar eclipse the moon enters the earth’s shadow—both excellent opinions but he entertained absurd ideas of the vortical motion of the heavens whisking stones into the sky there to be ignited by the fiery firmament to form stars he was prosecuted for this unsettling opinion and for maintaining that the moon is an inhabited earth he was defended by pericles  bc solon dabbled like many others in reforms of the calendar the common year of the greeks originally had  days—twelve months of thirty days solon’s year was  days it is obvious that these erroneous years would before long remove the summer to january and the winter to july to prevent this it was customary at regular intervals to intercalate days or months meton  bc introduced a reform based on the nineteen-year cycle this is not the same as the egyptian and chaldean eclipse cycle called saros of  lunations or a little over eighteen years the metonic cycle is  lunations or nineteen years after which period the sun and moon occupy the same position relative to the stars it is still used for fixing the date of easter the number of the year in melon’s cycle being the golden number of our prayer-books melon’s system divided the  lunations into months of thirty days and omitted every sixty-third day of the nineteen years twelve had twelve months and seven had thirteen months callippus  bc used a cycle four times as long  lunations but one day short of melon’s seventy-six years this was more correct eudoxus - bc is said to have travelled with plato in egypt he made astronomical observations in asia minor sicily and italy and described the starry heavens divided into constellations his name is connected with a planetary theory which as generally stated sounds most fanciful he imagined the fixed stars to be on a vault of heaven and the sun moon and planets to be upon similar vaults or spheres twenty-six revolving spheres in all the motion of each planet being resolved into its components and a separate sphere being assigned for each component motion callippus  bc increased the number to thirty-three it is now generally accepted that the real existence of these spheres was not suggested but the idea was only a mathematical conception to facilitate the construction of tables for predicting the places of the heavenly bodies aristotle - bc summed up the state of astronomical knowledge in his time and held the earth to be fixed in the centre of the world nicetas heraclides and ecphantes supposed the earth to revolve on its axis but to have no orbital motion the short epitome so far given illustrates the extraordinary deductive methods adopted by the ancient greeks but they went much farther in the same direction they seem to have been in great difficulty to explain how the earth is supported just as were those who invented the myth of atlas or the indians with the tortoise thales thought that the flat earth floated on water anaxagoras thought that being flat it would be buoyed up and supported on the air like a kite democritus thought it remained fixed like the donkey between two bundles of hay because it was equidistant from all parts of the containing sphere and there was no reason why it should incline one way rather than another empedocles attributed its state of rest to centrifugal force by the rapid circular movement of the heavens as water is stationary in a pail when whirled round by a string democritus further supposed that the inclination of the flat earth to the ecliptic was due to the greater weight of the southern parts owing to the exuberant vegetation for further references to similar efforts of imagination the reader is referred to sir george cornwall lewis’s historical survey of the astronomy of the ancients london  his list of authorities is very complete but some of his conclusions are doubtful at p  of that work he records the real opinions of socrates as set forth by xenophon and the reader will perhaps sympathise with socrates in his views on contemporary astronomy— with regard to astronomy he socrates considered a knowledge of it desirable to the extent of determining the day of the year or month and the hour of the night  but as to learning the courses of the stars to be occupied with the planets and to inquire about their distances from the earth and their orbits and the causes of their motions he strongly objected to such a waste of valuable time he dwelt on the contradictions and conflicting opinions of the physical philosophers  and in fine he held that the speculators on the universe and on the laws of the heavenly bodies were no better than madmen xen mem i  - plato born  bc the pupil of socrates the fellow-student of euclid and a follower of pythagoras studied science in his travels in egypt and elsewhere he was held in so great reverence by all learned men that a problem which he set to the astronomers was the keynote to all astronomical investigation from this date till the time of kepler in the sixteenth century he proposed to astronomers the problem of representing the courses of the planets by circular and uniform motions systematic observation among the greeks began with the rise of the alexandrian school aristillus and timocharis set up instruments and fixed the positions of the zodiacal stars near to which all the planets in their orbits pass thus facilitating the determination of planetary motions aristarchus - bc showed that the sun must be at least nineteen times as far off as the moon which is far short of the mark he also found the sun’s diameter correctly to be half a degree eratosthenes - bc measured the inclination to the equator of the sun’s apparent path in the heavens—ie he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic making it ° ’ confirming our knowledge of its continuous diminution during historical times he measured an arc of meridian from alexandria to syene assuan and found the difference of latitude by the length of a shadow at noon summer solstice he deduced the diameter of the earth  stadia unfortunately we do not know the length of the stadium he used hipparchus - bc may be regarded as the founder of observational astronomy he measured the obliquity of the ecliptic and agreed with eratosthenes he altered the length of the tropical year from  days  hours to  days  hours  minutes—still four minutes too much he measured the equation of time and the irregular motion of the sun and allowed for this in his calculations by supposing that the centre about which the sun moves uniformly is situated a little distance from the fixed earth he called this point the excentric the line from the earth to the excentric was called the line of apses a circle having this centre was called the equant and he supposed that a radius drawn to the sun from the excentric passes over equal arcs on the equant in equal times he then computed tables for predicting the place of the sun he proceeded in the same way to compute lunar tables making use of chaldan eclipses he was able to get an accurate value of the moon’s mean motion halley in  compared this value with his own measurements and so discovered the acceleration of the moon’s mean motion this was conclusively established but could not be explained by the newtonian theory for quite a long time he determined the plane of the moon’s orbit and its inclination to the ecliptic the motion of this plane round the pole of the ecliptic once in eighteen years complicated the problem he located the moon’s excentric as he had done the sun’s he also discovered some of the minor irregularities of the moon’s motion due as newton’s theory proves to the disturbing action of the sun’s attraction in the year  bc hipparchus observed a new star this upset every notion about the permanence of the fixed stars he then set to work to catalogue all the principal stars so as to know if any others appeared or disappeared here his experiences resembled those of several later astronomers who when in search of some special object have been rewarded by a discovery in a totally different direction on comparing his star positions with those of timocharis and aristillus he found no stars that had appeared or disappeared in the interval of  years but he found that all the stars seemed to have changed their places with reference to that point in the heavens where the ecliptic is ° from the poles of the earth—ie the equinox he found that this could be explained by a motion of the equinox in the direction of the apparent diurnal motion of the stars this discovery of precession of the equinoxes which takes place at the rate of  every year was necessary for the progress of accurate astronomical observations it is due to a steady revolution of the earth’s pole round the pole of the ecliptic once in  years in the opposite direction to the planetary revolutions', 'after ptolemy had published his book there seemed to be nothing more to do for the solar system except to go on observing and finding more and more accurate values for the constants involved--viz the periods of revolution the diameter of the deferent and its ratio to that of the epicycle the distance of the excentric from the centre of the deferent and the position of the line of apses besides the inclination and position of the plane of the planet’s orbit the only object ever aimed at in those days was to prepare tables for predicting the places of the planets it was not a mechanical problem there was no notion of a governing law of forces from this time onwards all interest in astronomy seemed in europe at least to sink to a low ebb when the caliph omar in the middle of the seventh century burnt the library of alexandria which had been the centre of intellectual progress that centre migrated to baghdad and the arabs became the leaders of science and philosophy in astronomy they made careful observations in the middle of the ninth century albategnius a syrian prince improved the value of excentricity of the sun’s orbit observed the motion of the moon’s apse and thought he detected a smaller progression of the sun’s apse his tables were much more accurate than ptolemy’s abul wefa in the tenth century seems to have discovered the moon’s variation meanwhile the moors were leaders of science in the west and arzachel of toledo improved the solar tables very much ulugh begh grandson of the great tamerlane the tartar built a fine observatory at samarcand in the fifteenth century and made a great catalogue of stars the first since the time of hipparchus at the close of the fifteenth century king alphonso of spain employed computers to produce the alphonsine tables  ad purbach translated ptolemy’s book and observations were carried out in germany by muller known as regiomontanus and waltherus nicolai copernicus a sclav was born in  at thorn in polish prussia he studied at cracow and in italy he was a priest and settled at frauenberg he did not undertake continuous observations but devoted himself to simplifying the planetary systems and devising means for more accurately predicting the positions of the sun moon and planets he had no idea of framing a solar system on a dynamical basis his great object was to increase the accuracy of the calculations and the tables the results of his cogitations were printed just before his death in an interesting book de revolutionibus orbium celestium it is only by careful reading of this book that the true position of copernicus can be realised he noticed that nicetas and others had ascribed the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens to a real daily rotation of the earth about its axis in the opposite direction to the apparent motion of the stars also in the writings of martianus capella he learnt that the egyptians had supposed mercury and venus to revolve round the sun and to be carried with him in his annual motion round the earth he noticed that the same supposition if extended to mars jupiter and saturn would explain easily why they and especially mars seem so much brighter in opposition for mars would then be a great deal nearer to the earth than at other times it would also explain the retrograde motion of planets when in opposition we must here notice that at this stage copernicus was actually confronted with the system accepted later by tycho brahe with the earth fixed but he now recalled and accepted the views of pythagoras and others according to which the sun is fixed and the earth revolves and it must be noted that geometrically there is no difference of any sort between the egyptian or tychonic system and that of pythagoras as revived by copernicus except that on the latter theory the stars ought to seem to move when the earth changes its position—a test which failed completely with the rough means of observation then available the radical defect of all solar systems previous to the time of kepler  ad was the slavish yielding to plato’s dictum demanding uniform circular motion for the planets and the consequent evolution of the epicycle which was fatal to any conception of a dynamical theory copernicus could not sever himself from this obnoxious tradition it is true that neither the pythagorean nor the egypto-tychonic system required epicycles for explaining retrograde motion as the ptolemaic theory did furthermore either system could use the excentric of hipparchus to explain the irregular motion known as the equation of the centre but copernicus remarked that he could also use an epicycle for this purpose or that he could use both an excentric and an epicycle for each planet and so bring theory still closer into accord with observation and this he proceeded to do moreover observers had found irregularities in the moon’s motion due as we now know to the disturbing attraction of the sun to correct for these irregularities copernicus introduced epicycle on epicycle in the lunar orbit this is in its main features the system propounded by copernicus but attention must to state the case fully be drawn to two points to be found in his first and sixth books respectively the first point relates to the seasons and it shows a strange ignorance of the laws of rotating bodies to use the words of delambre in drawing attention to the strange conception he imagined that the earth revolving round the sun ought always to show to it the same face the contrary phenomena surprised him to explain them he invented a third motion and added it to the two real motions rotation and orbital revolution by this third motion the earth he held made a revolution on itself and on the poles of the ecliptic once a year  copernicus did not know that motion in a straight line is the natural motion and that motion in a curve is the resultant of several movements he believed with aristotle that circular motion was the natural one copernicus made this rotation of the earth’s axis about the pole of the ecliptic retrograde ie opposite to the orbital revolution and by making it perform more than one complete revolution in a year the added part being / of the whole he was able to include the precession of the equinoxes in his explanation of the seasons his explanation of the seasons is given on leaf  of his book the pages of this book are not all numbered only alternate pages or leaves in his sixth book he discusses the inclination of the planetary orbits to the ecliptic in regard to this the theory of copernicus is unique and it will be best to explain this in the words of grant in his great work he says— copernicus as we have already remarked did not attack the principle of the epicyclical theory he merely sought to make it more simple by placing the centre of the earth’s orbit in the centre of the universe this was the point to which the motions of the planets were referred for the planes of their orbits were made to pass through it and their points of least and greatest velocities were also determined with reference to it by this arrangement the sun was situate mathematically near the centre of the planetary system but he did not appear to have any physical connexion with the planets as the centre of their motions according to copernicus’ sixth book the planes of the planetary orbits do not pass through the sun and the lines of apses do not pass through to the sun such was the theory advanced by copernicus the earth moves in an epicycle on a deferent whose centre is a little distance from the sun the planets move in a similar way on epicycles but their deferents have no geometrical or physical relation to the sun the moon moves on an epicycle centred on a second epicycle itself centred on a deferent excentric to the earth the earth’s axis rotates about the pole of the ecliptic making one revolution and a twenty-six thousandth part of a revolution in the sidereal year in the opposite direction to its orbital motion in view of this fanciful structure it must be noted in fairness to copernicus that he repeatedly states that the reader is not obliged to accept his system as showing the real motions that it does not matter whether they be true even approximately or not so long as they enable us to compute tables from which the places of the planets among the stars can be predicted he says that whoever is not satisfied with this explanation must be contented by being told that mathematics are for mathematicians mathematicis mathematica scribuntur at the same time he expresses his conviction over and over again that the earth is in motion it is with him a pious belief just as it was with pythagoras and his school and with aristarchus but as dreyer says in his most interesting book tycho brahe proofs of the physical truth of his system copernicus had given none and could give none any more than pythagoras or aristarchus there was nothing so startlingly simple in his system as to lead the cautious astronomer to accept it as there was in the later keplerian system and the absence of parallax in the stars seemed to condemn his system which had no physical basis to recommend it and no simplification at all over the egypto-tychonic system to which copernicus himself drew attention it has been necessary to devote perhaps undue space to the interesting work of copernicus because by a curious chance his name has become so widely known he has been spoken of very generally as the founder of the solar system that is now accepted this seems unfair and on reading over what has been written about him at different times it will be noticed that the astronomers—those who have evidently read his great book—are very cautious in the words with which they eulogise him and refrain from attributing to him the foundation of our solar system which is entirely due to kepler it is only the more popular writers who give the idea that a revolution had been effected when pythagoras’ system was revived and when copernicus supported his view that the earth moves and is not fixed it may be easy to explain the association of the name of copernicus with the keplerian system but the time has long passed when the historian can support in any way this popular error which was started not by astronomers acquainted with kepler’s work but by those who desired to put the church in the wrong by extolling copernicus copernicus dreaded much the abuse he expected to receive from philosophers for opposing the authority of aristotle who had declared that the earth was fixed so he sought and obtained the support of the church dedicating his great work to pope paul iii in a lengthy explanatory epistle the bishop of cracow set up a memorial tablet in his honour copernicus was the most refined exponent and almost the last representative of the epicyclical school as has been already stated his successor tycho brahe supported the same use of epicycles and excentrics as copernicus though he held the earth to be fixed but tycho brahe was eminently a practical observer and took little part in theory and his observations formed so essential a portion of the system of kepler that it is only fair to include his name among these who laid the foundations of the solar system which we accept to-day in now taking leave of the system of epicycles let it be remarked that it has been held up to ridicule more than it deserves on reading airy’s account of epicycles in the beautifully clear language of his six lectures on astronomy the impression is made that the jointed bars there spoken of for describing the circles were supposed to be real this is no more the case than that the spheres of eudoxus and callippus were supposed to be real both were introduced only to illustrate the mathematical conception upon which the solar planetary and lunar tables were constructed the epicycles represented nothing more nor less than the first terms in the fourier series which in the last century has become a basis of such calculations both in astronomy and physics generally ', 'during the period of the intellectual and aesthetic revival at the beginning of the sixteenth century the spirit of the age was fostered by the invention of printing by the downfall of the byzantine empire and the scattering of greek fugitives carrying the treasures of literature through western europe by the works of raphael and michael angelo by the reformation and by the extension of the known world through the voyages of spaniards and portuguese during that period there came to the front the founder of accurate observational astronomy tycho brahe a dane born in  of noble parents was the most distinguished diligent and accurate observer of the heavens since the days of hipparchus  years before tycho was devoted entirely to his science from childhood and the opposition of his parents only stimulated him in his efforts to overcome difficulties he soon grasped the hopelessness of the old deductive methods of reasoning and decided that no theories ought to be indulged in until preparations had been made by the accumulation of accurate observations we may claim for him the title of founder of the inductive method for a complete life of this great man the reader is referred to dreyer’s tycho brahe edinburgh  containing a complete bibliography the present notice must be limited to noting the work done and the qualities of character which enabled him to attain his scientific aims and which have been conspicuous in many of his successors he studied in germany but king frederick of denmark appreciating his great talents invited him to carry out his life’s work in that country he granted to him the island of hveen gave him a pension and made him a canon of the cathedral of roskilde on that island tycho brahe built the splendid observatory which he called uraniborg and later a second one for his assistants and students called stjerneborg these he fitted up with the most perfect instruments and never lost a chance of adding to his stock of careful observations the account of all these instruments and observations printed at his own press on the island was published by tycho brahe himself and the admirable and numerous engravings bear witness to the excellence of design and the stability of his instruments his mechanical skill was very great and in his workmanship he was satisfied with nothing but the best he recognised the importance of rigidity in the instruments and whereas these had generally been made of wood he designed them in metal his instruments included armillae like those which had been used in alexandria and other armillae designed by himself—sextants mural quadrants large celestial globes and various instruments for special purposes he lived before the days of telescopes and accurate clocks he invented the method of sub-dividing the degrees on the arc of an instrument by transversals somewhat in the way that pedro nunez had proposed he originated the true system of observation and reduction of observations recognising the fact that the best instrument in the world is not perfect and with each of his instruments he set to work to find out the errors of graduation and the errors of mounting the necessary correction being applied to each observation when he wanted to point his instrument exactly to a star he was confronted with precisely the same difficulty as is met in gunnery and rifle-shooting the sights and the object aimed at cannot be in focus together and a great deal depends on the form of sight tycho brahe invented and applied to the pointers of his instruments an aperture-sight of variable area like the iris diaphragm used now in photography this enabled him to get the best result with stars of different brightness the telescope not having been invented he could not use a telescopic-sight as we now do in gunnery this not only removes the difficulty of focussing but makes the minimum visible angle smaller helmholtz has defined the minimum angle measurable with the naked eye as being one minute of arc in view of this it is simply marvellous that when the positions of tycho’s standard stars are compared with the best modern catalogues his probable error in right ascension is only ±   and in declination only ±   clocks of a sort had been made but tycho brahe found them so unreliable that he seldom used them and many of his position-measurements were made by measuring the angular distances from known stars taking into consideration the absence of either a telescope or a clock and reading his account of the labour he bestowed upon each observation we must all agree that kepler who inherited these observations in ms was justified under the conditions then existing in declaring that there was no hope of anyone ever improving upon them in the year  on november th tycho discovered in cassiopeia a new star of great brilliance and continued to observe it until the end of january  so incredible to him was such an event that he refused to believe his own eyes until he got others to confirm what he saw he made accurate observations of its distance from the nine principal stars in casseiopeia and proved that it had no measurable parallax later he employed the same method with the comets of       and  and proved that they too had no measurable parallax and must be very distant the startling discovery that stars are not necessarily permanent that new stars may appear and possibly that old ones may disappear had upon him exactly the same effect that a similar occurrence had upon hipparchus  years before he felt it his duty to catalogue all the principal stars so that there should be no mistake in the future during the construction of his catalogue of  stars he prepared and used accurate tables of refraction deduced from his own observations thus he eliminated so far as naked eye observations required the effect of atmospheric refraction which makes the altitude of a star seem greater than it really is tycho brahe was able to correct the lunar theory by his observations copernicus had introduced two epicycles on the lunar orbit in the hope of obtaining a better accordance between theory and observation and he was not too ambitious as his desire was to get the tables accurate to ten minutes tycho brahe found that the tables of copernicus were in error as much as two degrees he re-discovered the inequality called variation by observing the moon in all phases—a thing which had not been attended to it is remarkable that in the nineteenth century sir george airy established an altazimuth at greenwich observatory with this special object to get observations of the moon in all phases he also discovered other lunar equalities and wanted to add another epicycle to the moon’s orbit but he feared that these would soon become unmanageable if further observations showed more new inequalities but as it turned out the most fruitful work of tycho brahe was on the motions of the planets and especially of the planet mars for it was by an examination of these results that kepler was led to the discovery of his immortal laws after the death of king frederick the observatories of tycho brahe were not supported the gigantic power and industry displayed by this determined man were accompanied as often happens by an overbearing manner intolerant of obstacles this led to friction and eventually the observatories were dismantled and tycho brahe was received by the emperor rudolph ii who placed a house in prague at his disposal here he worked for a few years with kepler as one of his assistants and he died in the year  it is an interesting fact that tycho brahe had a firm conviction that mundane events could be predicted by astrology and that this belief was supported by his own predictions it has already been stated that tycho brahe maintained that observation must precede theory he did not accept the copernican theory that the earth moves but for a working hypothesis he used a modification of an old egyptian theory mathematically identical with that of copernicus but not involving a stellar parallax he says de mundi etc that the ptolemean system was too complicated and the new one which that great man copernicus had proposed following in the footsteps of aristarchus of samos though there was nothing in it contrary to mathematical principles was in opposition to those of physics as the heavy and sluggish earth is unfit to move and the system is even opposed to the authority of scripture the absence of annual parallax further involves an incredible distance between the outermost planet and the fixed stars we are bound to admit that in the circumstances of the case so long as there was no question of dynamical forces connecting the members of the solar system his reasoning as we should expect from such a man is practical and sound it is not surprising then that astronomers generally did not readily accept the views of copernicus that luther luther’s tischreden pp   derided him in his usual pithy manner that melancthon initia doctrinae physicae said that scripture and also science are against the earth’s motion and that the men of science whose opinion was asked for by the cardinals who wished to know whether galileo was right or wrong looked upon copernicus as a weaver of fanciful theories johann kepler is the name of the man whose place as is generally agreed would have been the most difficult to fill among all those who have contributed to the advance of astronomical knowledge he was born at wiel in the duchy of wurtemberg in  he held an appointment at gratz in styria and went to join tycho brahe in prague and to assist in reducing his observations these came into his possession when tycho brahe died the emperor rudolph entrusting to him the preparation of new tables called the rudolphine tables founded on the new and accurate observations he had the most profound respect for the knowledge skill determination and perseverance of the man who had reaped such a harvest of most accurate data and though tycho hardly recognised the transcendent genius of the man who was working as his assistant and although there were disagreements between them kepler held to his post sustained by the conviction that with these observations to test any theory he would be in a position to settle for ever the problem of the solar system illustration portrait of johannes kepler  by f wanderer from reitlinger’s johannes kepler original in strassburg it has seemed to many that plato’s demand for uniform circular motion linear or angular was responsible for a loss to astronomy of good work during fifteen hundred years for a hundred ill-considered speculative cosmogonies for dissatisfaction amounting to disgust with these a priori guesses and for the relegation of the science to less intellectual races than greeks and other europeans nobody seemed to dare to depart from this fetish of uniform angular motion and circular orbits until the insight boldness and independence of johann kepler opened up a new world of thought and of intellectual delight', 'in our excursion to the valley with sandstone ledges we witnessed a process which is going forward in all lands everywhere the rocks are crumbling away their fragments are creeping down hillsides to the stream ways and are carried by the streams to the sea where they are rebuilt into rocky layers when again the rocks are lifted to form land the process will begin anew again they will crumble and creep down slopes and be washed by streams to the sea let us begin our study of this long cycle of change at the point where rocks disintegrate and decay under the action of the weather in studying now a few outcrops and quarries we shall learn a little of some common rocks and how they weather away stratification and jointing at the sandstone ledges we saw that the rock was divided into parallel layers the thicker layers are known as strata and the thin leaves into which each stratum may sometimes be split are termed laminae to a greater or less degree these layers differ from each other in fineness of grain showing that the material has been sorted the planes which divide them are called bedding planes besides the bedding planes there are other division planes which cut across the strata from top to bottom these are found in all rocks and are known as joints two sets of joints running at about right angles to each other together with the bedding planes divide the sandstone into quadrangular blocks sandstone examining a piece of sandstone we find it composed of grains quite like those of river sand or of sea beaches most of the grains are of a clear glassy mineral called quartz these quartz grains are very hard and will scratch the steel of a knife blade they are not affected by acid and their broken surfaces are irregular like those of broken glass the grains of sandstone are held together by some cement this may be calcareous consisting of soluble carbonate of lime in brown sandstones the cement is commonly ferruginous—hydrated iron oxide or iron rust forming the bond somewhat as in the case of iron nails which have rusted together the strongest and most lasting cement is siliceous and sand rocks whose grains are closely cemented by silica the chemical substance of which quartz is made are known as quartzites we are now prepared to understand how sandstone is affected by the action of the weather on ledges where the rock is exposed to view its surface is more or less discolored and the grains are loose and may be rubbed off with the finger on gentle slopes the rock is covered with a soil composed of sand which evidently is crumbled sandstone and dark carbonaceous matter derived from the decay of vegetation clearly it is by the dissolving of the cement that the rock thus breaks down to loose sand a piece of sandstone with calcareous cement or a bit of old mortar which is really an artificial stone also made of sand cemented by lime may be treated in a test tube with hydrochloric acid to illustrate the process a limestone quarry here also we find the rock stratified and jointed fig  on the quarry face the rock is distinctly seen to be altered for some distance from its upper surface below the altered zone the rock is sound and is quarried for building but the altered upper layers are too soft and broken to be used for this purpose if the limestone is laminated the laminae here have split apart although below they hold fast together near the surface the stone has become rotten and crumbles at the touch while on the top it has completely broken down to a thin layer of limestone meal on which rests a fine reddish clay limestone is made of minute grains of carbonate of lime all firmly held together by a calcareous cement a piece of the stone placed in a test tube with hydrochloric acid dissolves with brisk effervescence leaving the insoluble impurities which were disseminated through it at the bottom of the tube as a little clay we can now understand the changes in the upper layers of the quarry at the surface of the rock the limestone has completely dissolved leaving the insoluble residue as a layer of reddish clay immediately below the clay the rock has disintegrated into meal where the cement between the limestone grains has been removed while beneath this the laminae are split apart where the cement has been dissolved only along the planes of lamination where the stone is more porous as these changes in the rock are greatest at the surface and diminish downward we infer that they have been caused by agents working downward from the surface at certain points these agencies have been more effective than elsewhere the upper rock surface is pitted joints are widened as they approach the surface and along these seams we may find that the rock is altered even down to the quarry floor a shale pit let us now visit some pit where shale—a laminated and somewhat hardened clay—is quarried for the manufacture of brick the laminae of this fine-grained rock may be as thin as cardboard in places and close joints may break the rock into small rhombic blocks on the upper surface we note that the shale has weathered to a clayey soil in which all traces of structure have been destroyed the clay and the upper layers of the shale beneath it are reddish or yellow while in many cases the color of the unaltered rock beneath is blue the sedimentary rocks the three kinds of layered rocks whose acquaintance we have made—sandstone limestone and shale—are the leading types of the great group of stratified or sedimentary rocks this group includes all rocks made of sediments their materials having settled either in water upon the bottoms of rivers lakes or seas or on dry land as in the case of deposits made by the wind and by glaciers sedimentary rocks are divided into the fragmental rocks—which are made of fragments either coarse or fine—and the far less common rocks which are constituted of chemical precipitates the sedimentary rocks are divided according to their composition into the following classes  the arenaceous or quartz rocks including beds of loose sand and gravel sandstone quartzite and conglomerate a rock made of cemented rounded gravel or pebbles  the calcareous or lime rocks including limestone and a soft white rock formed of calcareous powder known as chalk  the argillaceous or clay rocks including muds clays and shales these three classes pass by mixture into one another thus there are limy and clayey sandstones sandy and clayey limestones and sandy and limy shales granite this familiar rock may be studied as an example of the second great group of rocks—the unstratified or igneous rocks these are not made of cemented sedimentary grains but of interlocking crystals which have crystallized from a molten mass examining a piece of granite the most conspicuous crystals which meet the eye are those of feldspar they are commonly pink white or yellow and break along smooth cleavage planes which reflect the light like tiny panes of glass mica may be recognized by its glittering plates which split into thin elastic scales a third mineral harder than steel breaking along irregular surfaces like broken glass we identify as quartz how granite alters under the action of the weather may be seen in outcrops where it forms the bed rock or country rock underlying the loose formations of the surface and in many parts of the northern states where granite bowlders and pebbles more or less decayed may be found in a surface sheet of stony clay called the drift of the different minerals composing granite quartz alone remains unaltered mica weathers to detached flakes which have lost their elasticity the feldspar crystals have lost their luster and hardness and even have decayed to clay where long- weathered granite forms the country rock it often may be cut with spade or trowel for several feet from the surface so rotten is the feldspar and here the rock is seen to break down to a clayey soil containing grains of quartz and flakes of mica these are a few simple illustrations of the surface changes which some of the common kinds of rocks undergo the agencies by which these changes are brought about we will now take up under two divisions—chemical agencies producing rock decay and mechanical agencies producing rock disintegration', 'we have seen that rocks are everywhere slowly wasting away they are broken in pieces by frost by tree roots and by heat and cold they dissolve and decompose under the chemical action of water and the various corrosive substances which it contains leaving their insoluble residues as residual clays and sands upon the surface as a result there is everywhere forming a mantle of rock waste which covers the land it is well to imagine how the country would appear were this mantle with its soil and vegetation all scraped away or had it never been formed the surface of the land would then be everywhere of bare rock as unbroken as a quarry floor the thickness of the mantle in any locality the thickness of the mantle of rock waste depends as much on the rate at which it is constantly being removed as on the rate at which it is forming on the face of cliffs it is absent for here waste is removed as fast as it is made where waste is carried away more slowly than it is produced it accumulates in time to great depth the granite of pikes peak is disintegrated to a depth of twenty feet in the city of washington granite rock is so softened to a depth of eighty feet that it can be removed with pick and shovel about atlanta georgia the rocks are completely rotted for one hundred feet from the surface while the beginnings of decay may be noticed at thrice that depth in places in southern brazil the rock is decomposed to a depth of four hundred feet in southwestern wisconsin a reddish residual clay has an average depth of thirteen feet on broad uplands where it has been removed to the least extent the country rock on which it rests is a limestone with about ten per cent of insoluble impurities at least how thick then was that portion of the limestone which has rotted down to the clay distinguishing characteristics of residual waste we must learn to distinguish waste formed in place by the action of the weather from the products of other geological agencies residual waste is unstratified it contains no substances which have not been derived from the weathering of the parent rock there is a gradual transition from residual waste into the unweathered rock beneath waste resting on sound rock evidently has been shifted and was not formed in place in certain regions of southern missouri the land is covered with a layer of broken flints and red clay while the country rock is limestone the limestone contains nodules of flint and we may infer that it has been by the decay and removal of thick masses of limestone that the residual layer of clay and flints has been left upon the surface flint is a form of quartz dull-lustered usually gray or blackish in color and opaque except on thinnest edges where it is translucent over much of the northern states there is spread an unstratified stony clay called the drift it often rests on sound rocks it contains grains of sand pebbles and bowlders composed of many different minerals and rocks that the country rock cannot furnish hence the drift cannot have been formed by the decay of the rock of the region a shale or limestone for example cannot waste to a clay containing granite pebbles the origin of the drift will be explained in subsequent chapters the differences in rocks are due more to their soluble than to their insoluble constituents the latter are few in number and are much the same in rocks of widely different nature being chiefly quartz silicate of alumina and iron oxide by the removal of their soluble parts very many and widely different rocks rot down to a residual clay gritty with particles of quartz and colored red or yellow with iron oxide in a broad way the changes which rocks undergo in weathering are an adaptation to the environment in which they find themselves at the earths surface—an environment different from that in which they were formed under sea or under ground in open air where they are attacked by various destructive agents few of the rock- making minerals are stable compounds except quartz the iron oxides and the silicate of alumina and so it is to one or more of these comparatively insoluble substances that most rocks are reduced by long decay which produces a mantle of finer waste frost or chemical decay which a thicker mantle in what respects would you expect that the mantle of waste would differ in warm humid lands like india in frozen countries like alaska and in deserts such as the sahara the soil the same agencies which produce the mantle of waste are continually at work upon it breaking it up into finer and finer particles and causing its more complete decay thus on the surface where the waste has weathered longest it is gradually made fine enough to support the growth of plants and is then known as soil the coarser waste beneath is sometimes spoken of as subsoil soil usually contains more or less dark carbonaceous decaying organic matter called humus and is then often termed the humus layer soil forms not only on waste produced in place from the rock beneath but also on materials which have been transported such as sheets of glacial drift and river deposits until rocks are reduced to residual clays the work of the weather is more rapid and effective on the fragments of the mantle of waste than on the rocks from which waste is being formed why any fresh excavation of cellar or cistern or cut for road or railway will show the characteristics of the humus layer it may form only a gray film on the surface or we may find it a layer a foot or more thick dark or even black above and growing gradually lighter in color as it passes by insensible gradations into the subsoil in some way the decaying vegetable matter continually forming on the surface has become mingled with the material beneath it how humus and the subsoil are mingled the mingling of humus and the subsoil is brought about by several means the roots of plants penetrate the waste and when they die leave their decaying substance to fertilize it leaves and stems falling on the surface are turned under by several agents earthworms and other animals whose home is in the waste drag them into their burrows either for food or to line their nests trees overthrown by the wind roots and all turn over the soil and subsoil and mingle them together bacteria also work in the waste and contribute to its enrichment the animals living in the mantle do much in other ways toward the making of soil they bring the coarser fragments from beneath to the surface where the waste weathers more rapidly their burrows allow air and water to penetrate the waste more freely and to affect it to greater depths ants in the tropics the mantle of waste is worked over chiefly by ants they excavate underground galleries and chambers extending sometimes as much as fourteen feet below the surface and build mounds which may reach as high above it in some parts of paraguay and southern brazil these mounds like gigantic potato hills cover tracts of considerable area in search for its food—the dead wood of trees—the so-called white ant constructs runways of earth about the size of gas pipes reaching from the base of the tree to the topmost branches on the plateaus of central africa explorers have walked for miles through forests every tree of which was plastered with these galleries of mud each grain of earth used in their construction is moistened and cemented by slime as it is laid in place by the ant and is thus acted on by organic chemical agents sooner or later these galleries are beaten down by heavy rains and their fertilizing substances are scattered widely by the winds earthworms in temperate regions the waste is worked over largely by earthworms in making their burrows worms swallow earth in order to extract from it any nutritive organic matter which it may contain they treat it with their digestive acids grind it in their stony gizzards and void it in castings on the surface of the ground it was estimated by darwin that in many parts of england each year on every acre more than ten tons of earth pass through the bodies of earthworms and are brought to the surface and that every few years the entire soil layer is thus worked over by them in all these ways the waste is made fine and stirred and enriched grain by grain the subsoil with its fresh mineral ingredients is brought to the surface and the rich organic matter which plants and animals have taken from the atmosphere is plowed under thus nature plows and harrows on the great worlds farm to make ready and ever to renew a soil fit for the endless succession of her crops the world processes by which rocks are continually wasting away are thus indispensable to the life of plants and animals the organic world is built on the ruins of the inorganic and because the solid rocks have been broken down into soil men are able to live upon the earth solar energy the source of the energy which accomplishes all this necessary work is the sun it is the radiant energy of the sun which causes the disintegration of rocks which lifts vapor into the atmosphere to fall as rain which gives life to plants and animals considering the earth in a broad way we may view it as a globe of solid rock—the lithosphere—surrounded by two mobile envelopes the envelope of air—the atmosphere and the envelope of water—the hydrosphere under the action of solar energy these envelopes are in constant motion water from the hydrosphere is continually rising in vapor into the atmosphere the air of the atmosphere penetrates the hydrosphere—for its gases are dissolved in all waters—and both air and water enter and work upon the solid earth by their action upon the lithosphere they have produced a third envelope—the mantle of rock waste this envelope also is in movement not indeed as a whole but particle by particle the causes which set its particles in motion and the different forms which the mantle comes to assume we will now proceed to study', 'at the sandstone ledges which we first visited we saw not only that the rocks were crumbling away but also that grains and fragments of them were creeping down the slopes of the valley to the stream and were carried by it onward toward the sea this process is going on everywhere slowly it may be and with many interruptions but surely the waste of the land moves downward to the sea we may divide its course into two parts—the path to the stream which we will now consider and its carriage onward by the stream which we will defer to a later chapter gravity the chief agent concerned in the movement of waste is gravity each particle of waste feels the unceasing downward pull of the earths mass and follows it when free to do so all agencies which produce waste tend to set its particles free and in motion and therefore cooperate with gravity on cliffs rocks fall when wedged off by frost or by roots of trees and when detached by any other agency on slopes of waste water freezes in chinks between stones and in pores between particles of soil and wedges them apart animals and plants stir the waste heat expands it cold contracts it the strokes of the raindrops drive loose particles down the slope and the wind lifts and lets them fall of all these movements gravity assists those which are downhill and retards those which are uphill on the whole therefore the downhill movements prevail and the mantle of waste block by block and grain by grain creeps along the downhill path a slab of sandstone laid on another of the same kind at an angle of  degrees and left in the open air was found to creep down the slope at the rate of a little more than a millimeter a month explain why it did so rain the most efficient agent in the carriage of waste to the streams is the rain it moves particles of soil by the force of the blows of the falling drops and washes them down all slopes to within reach of permanent streams on surfaces unprotected by vegetation as on plowed fields and in arid regions the rain wears furrows and gullies both in the mantle of waste and in exposures of unaltered rock fig  at the foot of a hill we may find that the soil has accumulated by creep and wash to the depth of several feet while where the hillside is steepest the soil may be exceedingly thin or quite absent because removed about as fast as formed against the walls of an abbey built on a slope in wales seven hundred years ago the creeping waste has gathered on the uphill side to a depth of seven feet the slow-flowing sheet of waste is often dammed by fences and walls whose uphill side gathers waste in a few years so as to show a distinctly higher surface than the downhill side especially in plowed fields where the movement is least checked by vegetation talus at the foot of cliffs there is usually to be found a slope of rock fragments which clearly have fallen from above such a heap of waste is known as talus the amount of talus in any place depends both on the rate of its formation and the rate of its removal talus forms rapidly in climates where mechanical disintegration is most effective where rocks are readily broken into blocks because closely jointed and thinly bedded rather than massive and where they are firm enough to be detached in fragments of some size instead of in fine grains talus is removed slowly where it decays slowly either because of the climate or the resistance of the rock it may be rapidly removed by a stream flowing along its base in a moist climate a soluble rock such as massive limestone may form talus little if any faster than the talus weathers away a loose-textured sandstone breaks down into incoherent sand grains which in dry climates where unprotected by vegetation may be blown away as fast as they fall leaving the cliff bare to the base cliffs of such slow-decaying rocks as quartzite and granite when closely jointed accumulate talus in large amounts talus slopes may be so steep as to reach the angle of repose ie the steepest angle at which the material will lie this angle varies with different materials being greater with coarse and angular fragments than with fine rounded grains sooner or later a talus reaches that equilibrium where the amount removed from its surface just equals that supplied from the cliff above as the talus is removed and weathers away its slope retreats together with the retreat of the cliff as seen in figure  graded slopes where rocks weather faster than their waste is carried away the waste comes at last to cover all rocky ledges on the steeper slopes it is coarser and in more rapid movement than on slopes more gentle but mountain sides and hills and plains alike come to be mantled with sheets of waste which everywhere is creeping toward the streams such unbroken slopes worn or built to the least inclination at which the waste supplied by weathering can be urged onward are known as graded slopes of far less importance than the silent gradual creep of waste which is going on at all times everywhere about us are the startling local and spasmodic movements which we are now to describe avalanches on steep mountain sides the accumulated snows of winter often slip and slide in avalanches to the valleys below these rushing torrents of snow sweep their tracks clean of waste and are one of natures normal methods of moving it along the downhill path landslides another common and abrupt method of delivering waste to streams is by slips of the waste mantle in large masses after long rains and after winter frosts the cohesion between the waste and the sound rock beneath is loosened by seeping water underground the waste slips on the rock surface thus lubricated and plunges down the mountain side in a swift roaring torrent of mud and stones we may conveniently mention here a second type of landslide where masses of solid rock as well as the mantle of waste are involved in the sudden movement such slips occur when valleys have been rapidly deepened by streams or glaciers and their sides have not yet been graded a favorable condition is where the strata dip ie incline downwards towards the valley fig  or are broken by joint planes dipping in the same direction the upper layers including perhaps the entire mountain side have been cut across by the valley trench and are left supported only on the inclined surface of the underlying rocks water may percolate underground along this surface and loosen the cohesion between the upper and the underlying strata by converting the upper surface of a shale to soft wet clay by dissolving layers of a limestone or by removing the cement of a sandstone and converting it into loose sand when the inclined surface is thus lubricated the overlying masses may be launched into the valley below the solid rocks are broken and crushed in sliding and converted into waste consisting like that of talus of angular unsorted fragments blocks of all sizes being mingled pellmell with rock meal and dust the principal effects of landslides may be gathered from the following examples at gohna india in  the face of a spur four thousand feet high of the lower ranges of the himalayas slipped into the gorge of the headwaters of the ganges river in successive rock falls which lasted for three days blocks of stone were projected for a mile and clouds of limestone dust were spread over the surrounding country the debris formed a dam one thousand feet high extending for two miles along the valley a lake gathered behind this barrier gradually rising until it overtopped it in a little less than a year the upper portion of the dam then broke and a terrific rush of water swept down the valley in a wave which twenty miles away rose one hundred and sixty feet in height a narrow lake is still held by the strong base of the dam in  after forty days of incessant rain a cliff of sandstone slipped into the yangtse river in china reducing the width of the channel to eighty yards and causing formidable rapids at flims in switzerland a prehistoric landslip flung a dam eighteen hundred feet high across the headwaters of the rhine if spread evenly over a surface of twenty-eight square miles the material would cover it to a depth of six hundred and sixty feet the barrier is not yet entirely cut away and several lakes are held in shallow basins on its hummocky surface a slide from the precipitous river front of the citadel hill of quebec in  dashed across champlain street wrecking a number of houses and causing the death of forty-five persons the strata here are composed of steeply dipping slate in lofty mountain ranges there may not be a single valley without its traces of landslides so common there is this method of the movement of waste and of building to grade over-steepened slopes', 'we are now to consider a few of the forms into which rock masses are carved by the weather bowlders of weathering in many quarries and outcrops we may see that the blocks into which one or more of the uppermost layers have been broken along their joints and bedding planes are no longer angular as are those of the layers below the edges and corners of these blocks have been worn away by the weather such rounded cores known as bowlders of weathering are often left to strew the surface differential weathering this term covers all cases in which a rock mass weathers differently in different portions any weaker spots or layers are etched out on the surface leaving the more resistant in relief thus massive limestones become pitted where the weather drills out the weaker portions in these pits when once they are formed moisture gathers a little soil collects vegetation takes root and thus they are further enlarged until the limestone may be deeply honeycombed on the sides of canyons and elsewhere where the edges of strata are exposed the harder layers project as cliffs while the softer weather back to slopes covered with the talus of the harder layers above them it is convenient to call the former cliff makers and the latter slope makers differential weathering plays a large part in the sculpture of the land areas of weak rock are wasted to plains while areas of hard rock adjacent are still left as hills and mountain ridges as in the valleys and mountains of eastern pennsylvania but in such instances the lowering of the surface of the weaker rock is also due to the wear of streams and especially to the removal by them from the land of the waste which covers and protects the rocks beneath rocks owe their weakness to several different causes some such as beds of loose sand are soft and easily worn by rains some as limestone and gypsum for example are soluble even hard insoluble rocks are weak under the attack of the weather when they are closely divided by joints and bedding planes and are thus readily broken up into blocks by mechanical agencies outliers and monuments as cliffs retreat under the attack of the weather portions are left behind where the rock is more resistant or where the attack for any reason is less severe such remnant masses if large are known as outliers when note the rain furrows on the slope at the foot of the monuments in the foreground are seen fragments of petrified trunks of trees composed of silica and extremely resistant to the weather on the removal of the rock layers in which these fragments were imbedded they are left to strew the surface in the same way as are the residual flints of southern missouri flat-topped because of the protection of a resistant horizontal capping layer they are termed mesas—a term applied also to the flat-topped portions of dissected plateaus fig  retreating cliffs may fall back a number of miles behind their outliers before the latter are finally consumed monuments are smaller masses and may be but partially detached from the cliff face in the breaking down of sheets of horizontal strata outliers grow smaller and smaller and are reduced to massive rectangular monuments resembling castles fig  the rock castle falls into ruin leaving here and there an isolated tower the tower crumbles to a lonely pillar soon to be overthrown the various and often picturesque shapes of monuments depend on the kind of rock the attitude of the strata and the agent by which they are chiefly carved thus pillars may have a capital formed of a resistant stratum monuments may be undercut and come to rest on narrow pedestals wherever they weather more rapidly near the ground either because of the greater moisture there or—in arid climates—because worn at their base by drifting sands stony clays disintegrating under the rain often contain bowlders which protect the softer material beneath from the vertical blows of raindrops and thus come to stand on pedestals of some height one may sometimes see on the ground beneath dripping eaves pebbles left in the same way protecting tiny pedestals of sand mountain peaks and ridges most mountains have been carved out of great broadly uplifted folds and blocks of the earths crust running water and glacier ice have cut these folds and blocks into masses divided by deep valleys but it is by the weather for the most part that the masses thus separated have been sculptured to the present forms of the individual peaks and ridges frost and heat and cold sculpture high mountains to sharp tusklike peaks and ragged serrate crests where their waste is readily removed the matterhorn of the alps is a famous example of a mountain peak whose carving by the frost and other agents is in active progress on its face scarcely a rock anywhere is firmly attached and the fall of loosened stones is incessant mountain climbers who have camped at its base tell how huge rocks from time to time come leaping down its precipices followed by trains of dislodged smaller fragments and rock dust and how at night one may trace the course of the bowlders by the sparks which they strike from the mountain walls mount assiniboine canada fig  resembles the matterhorn in form and has been carved by the same agencies the needles of arizona are examples of sharp mountain peaks in a warm arid region sculptured chiefly by temperature changes chemical decay especially when carried on beneath a cover of waste and vegetation favors the production of rounded knobs and dome-shaped mountains the weather curve we have seen that weathering reduces the angular block quarried by the frost to a rounded bowlder by chipping off its corners and smoothing away its edges in much the same way weathering at last reduces to rounded hills the earth blocks cut by streams or formed in any other way high mountains may at first be sculptured by the weather to savage peaks fig  but toward the end of their life history they wear down to rounded hills fig  the weather curve which may be seen on the summits of low hills fig  is convex upward in figure  representing a cubic block of stone whose faces are a yard square how many square feet of surface are exposed to the weather by a cubic foot at a corner a by one situated in the middle of an edge b by one in the center of a side c how much faster will a and b weather than c and what will be the effect on the shape of the block the cooperation of various agencies in rock sculpture for the sake of clearness it is necessary to describe the work of each geological agent separately we must not forget however that in nature no agent works independently and alone that every result is the outcome of a long chain of causes thus in order that the mountain peak may be carved by the agents of disintegration the waste must be rapidly removed—a work done by many agents including some which we are yet to study and in order that the waste may be removed as fast as formed the region must first have been raised well above the level of the sea so that the agents of transportation could do their work effectively the sculpture of the rocks is accomplished only by the cooperation of many forces the constant removal of waste from the surface by creep and wash and carriage by streams is of the highest importance because it allows the destruction of the land by means of weathering to go on as long as any land remains above sea level if waste were not removed it would grow to be so thick as to protect the rock beneath from further weathering and the processes of destruction which we have studied would be brought to an end the very presence of the mantle of waste over the land proves that on the whole rocks weather more rapidly than their waste is removed the destruction of the land is going on as fast as the waste can be carried away we have now learned to see in the mantle of waste the record of the destructive action of the agencies of weathering on the rocks of the land surface similar records we shall find buried deeply among the rocks of the crust in old soils and in rocks pitted and decayed telling of old land surfaces long wasted by the weather ever since the dry land appeared these agencies have been as now quietly and unceasingly at work upon it and have ever been the chief means of the destruction of its rocks the vast bulk of the stratified rocks of the earths crust is made up almost wholly of the waste thus worn from ancient lands in studying the various geological agencies we must remember the almost inconceivable times in which they work the slowest process when multiplied by the immense time in which it is carried on produces great results the geologist looks upon the land forms of the earths surface as monuments which record the slow action of weathering and other agents during the ages of the past the mountain peak the rounded hill the wide plain which lies where hills and mountains once stood tell clearly of the great results which slow processes will reach when given long time in which to do their work we should accustom ourselves also to think of the results which weathering will sooner or later bring to pass the tombstone and the bowlder of the field which each year lose from their surfaces a few crystalline grains must in time be wholly destroyed the hill whose rocks are slowly rotting underneath a cover of waste must become lower and lower as the centuries and millenniums come and go and will finally disappear even the mountains are crumbling away continually and therefore are but fleeting features of the landscape', 'land waters we have seen how large is the part that water plays at and near the surface of the land in the processes of weathering and in the slow movement of waste down all slopes to the stream ways we now take up the work of water as it descends beneath the ground—a corrosive agent still and carrying in solution as its load the invisible waste of rocks derived from their soluble parts land waters have their immediate source in the rainfall by the heat of the sun water is evaporated from the reservoir of the ocean and from moist surfaces everywhere mingled as vapor with the air it is carried by the winds over sea and land and condensed it returns to the earth as rain or snow that part of the rainfall which descends on the ocean does not concern us but that which falls on the land accomplishes as it returns to the sea the most important work of all surface geological agencies the rainfall may be divided into three parts the first dries up being discharged into the air by evaporation either directly from the soil or through vegetation the second runs off over the surface to flood the streams the third soaks in the ground and is henceforth known as ground or underground water the descent of ground water seeping through the mantle of waste ground water soaks into the pores and crevices of the underlying rock all rocks of the upper crust of the earth are more or less porous and all drink in water impervious rocks such as granite clay and shale have pores so minute that the water which they take in is held fast within them by capillary attraction and none drains through pervious rocks on the other hand such as many sandstones have pore spaces so large that water filters through them more or less freely besides its seepage through the pores of pervious rocks water passes to lower levels through the joints and cracks by which all rocks near the surface are broken even the closest-grained granite has a pore space of  in  while sandstone may have a pore space of  in  sand is so porous that it may absorb a third of its volume of water and a loose loam even as much as one half the ground-water surface is the name given the upper surface of ground water the level below which all rocks are saturated in dry seasons the ground-water surface sinks for ground water is constantly seeping downward under gravity it is evaporated in the waste and its moisture is carried upward by capillarity and the roots of plants to the surface to be evaporated in the air in wet seasons these constant losses are more than made good by fresh supplies from that part of the rainfall which soaks into the ground and the ground-water surface rises in moist climates the ground-water surface fig  lies as a rule within a few feet of the land surface and conforms to it in a general way although with slopes of less inclination than those of the hills and valleys in dry climates permanent ground water may be found only at depths of hundreds of feet ground water is held at its height by the fact that its circulation is constantly impeded by capillarity and friction if it were as free to drain away as are surface streams it would sink soon after a rain to the level of the deepest valleys of the region wells and springs excavations made in permeable rocks below the ground-water surface fill to its level and are known as wells where valleys cut this surface permanent streams are formed the water either oozing forth along ill-defined areas or issuing at definite points called springs where it is concentrated by the structure of the rocks a level tract where the ground-water surface coincides with the surface of the ground is a swamp or marsh by studying a spring one may learn much of the ways and work of ground water spring water differs from that of the stream into which it flows in several respects if we test the spring with a thermometer during successive months we shall find that its temperature remains much the same the year round in summer it is markedly cooler than the stream in winter it is warmer and remains unfrozen while the latter perhaps is locked in ice this means that its underground path must lie at such a distance from the surface that it is little affected by summers heat and winters cold while the stream is often turbid with surface waste washed into it by rains the spring remains clear its water has been filtered during its slow movement through many small underground passages and the pores of rocks commonly the spring differs from the stream in that it carries a far larger load of dissolved rock chemical analysis proves that streams contain various minerals in solution but these are usually in quantities so small that they are not perceptible to the taste or feel but the water of springs is often well charged with soluble minerals in its slow long journey underground it has searched out the soluble parts of the rocks through which it seeps and has dissolved as much of them as it could when spring water is boiled away the invisible load which it has carried is left behind and in composition is found to be practically identical with that of the soluble ingredients of the country rock although to some extent the soluble waste of rocks is washed down surface slopes by the rain by far the larger part is carried downward by ground water and is delivered to streams by springs in limestone regions springs are charged with calcium carbonate the carbonate of lime and where the limestone is magnesian they contain magnesium carbonate also such waters are hard when used in washing the minerals which they contain combine with the fatty acids of soap to form insoluble curdy compounds when springs rise from rocks containing gypsum they are hard with calcium sulphate in granite regions they contain more or less soda and potash from the decay of feldspar the flow of springs varies much less during the different seasons of the year than does that of surface streams so slow is the movement of ground water through the rocks that even during long droughts large amounts remain stored above the levels of surface drainage movements of ground water ground water is in constant movement toward its outlets its rate varies according to many conditions but always is extremely slow even through loose sands beneath the beds of rivers it sometimes does not exceed a fifth of a mile a year in any region two zones of flow may be distinguished the upper zone of flow extends from the ground-water surface downward through the waste mantle and any permeable rocks on which the mantle rests as far as the first impermeable layer where the descending movement of the water is stopped the deep zones of flow occupy any pervious rocks which may be found below the impervious layer which lies nearest to the surface the upper zone is a vast sheet of water saturating the soil and rocks and slowly seeping downward through their pores and interstices along the slopes to the valleys where in part it discharges in springs and often unites also in a wide underflowing stream which supports and feeds the river fig  a city in a region of copious rains built on the narrow flood plain of a river overlooked by hills depends for its water supply on driven wells within the city limits sunk in the sand a few yards from the edge of the stream are these wells fed by water from the river percolating through the sand or by ground water on its way to the stream and possibly contaminated with the sewage of the town at what height does underground water stand in the wells of your region does it vary with the season have you ever known wells to go dry it may be possible to get data from different wells and to draw a diagram showing the ground-water surface as compared with the surface of the ground fissure springs and artesian wells the deeper zones of flow lie in pervious strata which are overlain by some impervious stratum such layers are often carried by their dip to great depths and water may circulate in them to far below the level of the surface streams and even of the sea when a fissure crosses a water- bearing stratum or aquifier water is forced upward by the pressure of the weight of the water contained in the higher parts of the stratum and may reach the surface as a fissure spring a boring which taps such an aquifer is known as an artesian well a name derived from a province in france where wells of this kind have been long in use the rise of the water in artesian wells and in fissure springs also depends on the following conditions illustrated in figure  the aquifer dips toward the region of the wells from higher ground where it outcrops and receives its water it is inclosed between an impervious layer above and water- tight or water-logged layers beneath the weight of the column of water thus inclosed in the aquifer causes water to rise in the well precisely as the weight of the water in a standpipe forces it in connected pipes to the upper stories of buildings which will supply the larger region with artesian wells an aquifer whose dip is steep or one whose dip is gentle which of the two aquifers their thickness being equal will have the larger outcrop and therefore be able to draw upon the larger amount of water from the rainfall illustrate with diagrams the zone of solution near the surface where the circulation of ground water is most active it oxidizes corrodes and dissolves the rocks through which it passes it leaches soils and subsoils of their lime and other soluble minerals upon which plants depend for their food it takes away the soluble cements of rocks it widens fissures and joints and opens winding passages along the bedding planes it may even remove whole beds of soluble rocks such as rock salt limestone or gypsum the work of ground water in producing landslides has already been noticed the zone in which the work of ground water is thus for the most part destructive we may call the zone of solution caves in massive limestone rocks ground water dissolves channels which sometimes form large caves fig  the necessary conditions for the excavation of caves of great size are well shown in central kentucky where an upland is built throughout of thick horizontal beds of limestone the absence of layers of insoluble or impervious rock in its structure allows a free circulation of ground water within it by the way of all natural openings in the rock these water ways have been gradually enlarged by solution and wear until the upland is honeycombed with caves five hundred open caverns are known in one county mammoth cave the largest of these caverns consists of a labyrinth of chambers and winding galleries whose total length is said to be as much as thirty miles one passage four miles long has an average width of about sixty feet and an average height of forty feet one of the great halls is three hundred feet in width and is overhung by a solid arch of limestone one hundred feet above the floor galleries at different levels are connected by well-like pits some of which measure two hundred and twenty-five feet from top to bottom through some of the lowest of these tunnels flows echo river still at work dissolving and wearing away the rock while on its dark way to appear at the surface as a great spring natural bridges as a cavern enlarges and the surface of the land above it is lowered by weathering the roof at last breaks down and the cave becomes an open ravine a portion of the roof may for a while remain forming a natural bridge sink holes in limestone regions channels under ground may become so well developed that the water of rains rapidly drains away through them ground water stands low and wells must be sunk deep to find it little or no surface water is left to form brooks thus across the limestone upland of central kentucky one meets but three surface streams in a hundred miles between their valleys surface water finds its way underground by means of sink holes these are pits commonly funnel shaped formed by the enlargement of crevice or joint by percolating water or by the breakdown of some portion of the roof of a cave by clogging of the outlet a sink hole may come to be filled by a pond central florida is a limestone region with its drainage largely subterranean and in part below the level even of the sea sink holes are common and many of them are occupied by lakelets great springs mark the point of issue of underground streams while some rise from beneath the sea silver spring one of the largest discharges from a basin eight hundred feet wide and thirty feet deep a little river navigable for small steamers to its source about the spring there are no surface streams for sixty miles the karst along the eastern coast of the adriatic as far south as montenegro lies a belt of limestone mountains singularly worn and honeycombed by the solvent action of water where forests have been cut from the mountain sides and the red soil has washed away the surface of the white limestone forms a pathless desert of rock where each square rod has been corroded into an intricate branch work of shallow furrows and sharp ridges great sink holes some of them six hundred feet deep and more pockmark the surface of the land the drainage is chiefly subterranean surface streams are rare and a portion of their courses is often under ground fragmentary valleys come suddenly to an end at walls of rock where the rivers which occupy the valleys plunge into dark tunnels to reappear some miles away ground water stands so far below the surface that it cannot be reached by wells and the inhabitants depend on rain water stored for household uses the finest cavern of europe the adelsberg grotto is in this region karst the name of a part of this country is now used to designate any region or landscape thus sculptured by the chemical action of surface and ground water we must remember that karst regions are rare and striking as is the work of their subterranean streams it is far less important than the work done by the sheets of underground water slowly seeping through all subsoils and porous rocks in other regions even when gathered into definite channels ground water does not have the erosive power of surface streams since it carries with it little or no rock waste regions whose underground drainage is so perfect that the development of surface streams has been retarded or prevented escape to a large extent the leveling action of surface running waters and may therefore stand higher than the surrounding country the hill honeycombed by luray cavern virginia has been attributed to this cause cavern deposits even in the zone of solution water may under certain circumstances deposit as well as erode as it trickles from the roof of caverns the lime carbonate which it has taken into solution from the layers of limestone above is deposited by evaporation in the air in icicle-like pendants called stalactites as the drops splash on the floor there are built up in the same way thicker masses called stalagmites which may grow to join the stalactites above forming pillars a stalagmitic crust often seals with rock the earth which accumulates in caverns together with whatever relics of cave dwellers either animals or men it may contain can you explain why slender stalactites formed by the drip of single drops are often hollow pipes the zone of cementation with increasing depth subterranean water becomes more and more sluggish in its movements and more and more highly charged with minerals dissolved from the rocks above at such depths it deposits these minerals in the pores of rocks cementing their grains together and in crevices and fissures forming mineral veins thus below the zone of solution where the work of water is to dissolve lies the zone of cementation where its work is chemical deposit a part of the invisible load of waste is thus transferred from rocks near the surface to those at greater depths as the land surface is gradually lowered by weathering and the work of rain and streams rocks which have lain deep within the zone of cementation are brought within the zone of solution thus there are exposed to view limestones whose cracks were filled with calcite crystallized carbonate of lime with quartz or other minerals and sandstones whose grains were well cemented many feet below the surface cavity filling small cavities in the rocks are often found more or less completely filled with minerals deposited from solution by water in its constant circulation underground the process may be illustrated by the deposit of salt crystals in a cup of evaporating brine but in the latter instance the solution is not renewed as in the case of cavities in the rocks a cavity thus lined with inward-pointing crystals is called a geode concretions ground water seeping through the pores of rocks may gather minerals disseminated throughout them into nodular masses called concretions thus silica disseminated through limestone is gathered into nodules of flint while geodes grow from the outside inwards concretions grow outwards from the center nor are they formed in already existing cavities as are geodes in soft clays concretions may as they grow press the clay aside in many other rocks concretions are made by the process of replacement molecule by molecule the rock is removed and the mineral of the concretion substituted in its place the concretion may in this way preserve intact the lamination lines or other structures of the rock clays and shales often contain concretions of lime carbonate of iron carbonate or of iron sulphide some fossil such as a leaf or shell frequently forms the nucleus around which the concretion grows why are building stones more easily worked when green than after their quarry water has dried out deposits of ground water in arid regions in arid lands where ground water is drawn by capillarity to the surface and there evaporates it leaves as surface incrustations the minerals held in solution white limy incrustations of this nature cover considerable tracts in northern mexico evaporating beneath the surface ground water may deposit a limy cement in beds of loose sand and gravel such firmly cemented layers are not uncommon in western kansas and nebraska where they are known as mortar beds thermal springs while the lower limit of surface drainage is sea level subterranean water circulates much below that depth and is brought again to the surface by hydrostatic pressure in many instances springs have a higher temperature than the average annual temperature of the region and are then known as thermal springs in regions of present or recent volcanic activity such as the yellowstone national park we may believe that the heat of thermal springs is derived from uncooled lavas perhaps not far below the surface but when hot springs occur at a distance of hundreds of miles from any volcano as in the case of the hot springs of bath england it is probable that their waters have risen from the heated rocks of the earths interior the springs of bath have a temperature of  degrees f  degrees above the average annual temperature of the place if we assume that the rate of increase in the earths internal heat is here the average rate  degree f to every sixty feet of descent we may conclude that the springs of bath rise from at least a depth of forty-two hundred feet water may descend to depths from which it can never be brought back by hydrostatic pressure it is absorbed by highly heated rocks deep below the surface from time to time some of this deep- seated water may be returned to open air in the steam of volcanic eruptions']\n"
